    Remember: DO NOT output anything else, only output the answer you make.
    Generate a solution of a given math problem strictly following this format:
    1. Identify key components of the problem
    2. Apply theorems/formulas with step-by-step derivation
    3. Perform calculations with intermediate verification
    4. Final answer in \boxed{} notation

    Format Requirements:
    - Prefix each step with "→" (use the actual arrow symbol, not its Unicode escape sequence)
    - Ensure all symbols and special characters are presented using LaTeX commands where appropriate (e.g., ≥ as \\geq, ÷ as \\div)

    Example Template:
    Problem: Find the minimum value of function f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 4 on interval [-1, 3]

    Solution:
    1. Find critical points:
    → f'(x) = 3x² - 6x
    → Set derivative to zero: 3x(x-2) = 0 ⇒ x=0, x=2

    2. Evaluate function at critical points and endpoints:
    → f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + 4 = -1 -3 +4 = 0.0000
    → f(0) = 0³ - 3(0)² +4 = 4.0000
    → f(2) = 8 - 12 +4 = 0.0000
    → f(3) = 27 - 27 +4 = 4.0000

    3. Compare values:
    → Minimum occurs at x=-1 and x=2

    Verification:
    → Second derivative test: f''(x) = 6x-6
    → f''(-1) = -12 < 0 (local max)
    → f''(2) = 6 > 0 (local min)

        7: We say that a finite set $\mathcal{S}$ in the plane is balanced if, for any two different points $A$, $B$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there is a point $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $AC=BC$. We say that $\mathcal{S}$ is centre-free if for any three points $A$, $B$, $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there is no point $P$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $PA=PB=PC$.

        Show that for all integers $n\geq 3$, there exists a balanced set consisting of $n$ points.

The line through $D$ perpendicular to $EF$ meets $\omega$ at $R$. Line $AR$ meets $\omega$ again at $P$. The circumcircles of triangle $PCE$ and $PBF$ meet again at $Q$.

        Prove that lines $DI$ and $PQ$ meet on the line through $A$ perpendicular to $AI$. (IMO 2019/6)

        9: Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $S$ be a finite set of odd prime numbers. Prove that there is at most one way (up to rotation and reflection) to place the elements of $S$ around the circle such that the product of any two neighbors is of the form $x^2+x+k$ for some positive integer $x$. (IMO 2022/3)

        9.5: An anti-Pascal triangle is an equilateral triangular array of numbers such that, except for the numbers in the bottom row, each number is the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers immediately below it. For example, the following is an anti-Pascal triangle with four rows which contains every integer from $1$ to $10$.
        \[
        \begin{array}{ c@{\hspace{4pt}}c@{\hspace{4pt}} c@{\hspace{4pt}}c@{\hspace{2pt}}c@{\hspace{2pt}}c@{\hspace{4pt}}c }

        & & 2 & & 6 & & \\
        & 5 & & 7 & & 1 & \\
        8 & & 3 & & 10 & & 9 \\
        \end{array}
        \]
        Does there exist an anti-Pascal triangle with $2018$ rows which contains every integer from $1$ to $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 2018$? (IMO 2018/3)

        10: Prove that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that the following statement is true: Consider an integer $n > 1$, and a set $\mathcal S$ of $n$ points in the plane such that the distance between any two different points in $\mathcal S$ is at least 1. It follows that there is a line $\ell$ separating $\mathcal S$ such that the distance from any point of $\mathcal S$ to $\ell$ is at least $cn^{-1/3}$.

        (A line $\ell$ separates a set of points S if some segment joining two points in $\mathcal S$ crosses $\ell$.) (IMO 2020/6)

        <example math problem>
        The problem requires finding the missing value in the equation

        \[
        \frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{18}=\frac{1}{\square}.
        \]

        In other words, determine the number that should replace the square such that the sum of the fractions on the left equals the fraction on the right.
        </example math problem>
        ## Summarization
        The problem requires finding a value that makes the equation $\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{18}=\\frac{1}{\\square}$. 
        This involves adding two fractions and determining the equivalent fraction.
        ## Difficulty
        Rating: 1
        Reason: This problem is straightforward and primarily involves basic fraction addition, making it suitable for early middle school students.

        </example math problem>
        Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a convex polygon with $n$ sides, $n\ge3$. Any set of $n - 3$ diagonals of $\mathcal{P}$ that do not intersect in the interior of the polygon determine a triangulation of $\mathcal{P}$ into $n - 2$ triangles. If $\mathcal{P}$ is regular and there is a triangulation of $\mathcal{P}$ consisting of only isosceles triangles, find all the possible values of $n$. 
        </example math problem>
        ## Summarization
        The problem asks for the possible values of $n$ for a regular n-sided polygon that can be completely triangulated into isosceles triangles using non-intersecting diagonals. 
        The solution involves analyzing the properties of the diagonals forming isosceles triangles and deducing that $n$ can be expressed in terms of powers of 2.
        ## Difficulty
        Rating: 7
        Reason: The problem involves understanding properties of isosceles triangles in the context of polygon triangulation and requires critical reasoning to establish 
        relationships between the number of sides and powers of 2, making it more complex than typical undergraduate-level problems.
