Rather than imitating Hammer\u2019s modernization of Gothic classics, Amicus developed its own niche with omnibus films. They were successful enough to be in full-fledged production for a decade, establishing a reputation as the go-to studio for horror anthologies. This, their introductory portmanteau film, clearly influenced by EC Comics, sets a pattern of to-be-expected unevenness. Still, Amicus installs themselves as a horror studio to be reckoned with, sparing no expense in procuring Hammer\u2019s top actors: Peter Cushing (who would star in all but one of the Amicus anthologies) and Christopher Lee. For its wraparound segment, Dr. Terror\u2019s House of Horrors opens to the duo (among other passengers) on a train. Dr. Schreck ((\u201cShreck\u201d is German for \u201cterror,\u201d and a nod to the famous star of F.W. Murnau\u2018s Nosferatu.)) (Cushing, saddled with a terrible German accent and glued on brows) pulls out a deck of tarot cards. \u201cPick a card, any card, and tape it three times,\u201d Schreck tells his fellow passengers. Each participant will hear of a fate that may await them. Among the passengers is Christopher Lee who will, of course, factor into one of the five narratives.\nIn \u201cWerewolf,\u201d Neil McCallum is an architect renovating an old dark house, which turns out to be cursed. The title monster is featured in this pedestrian tale of ancestral revenge with a \u201ctwist.\u201d\nWith Alan Freeman (better known as the U.K D.J. for \u201cPick of the Pops\u201d) served up as a snack for a venus fly trap, \u201cThe Creeping Vine,\u201d thankfully doesn\u2019t take itself so seriously. It is refreshingly lightheaded hokum.\n\u201cVoodoo\u201d is the worst of the lot; badly dated in its stereotypes, with Kenny Lynch belting out a stolen voodoo tune.\n\u201cDisembodied Hand,\u201d has elitist art critic Franklin Marsh (Lee) driving artist Eric Landor (Michael Gough) to suicide. Landor\u2019s severed hand returns to exact revenge on the mean critic. It\u2019s in the spirit of The Beast with Five Fingers, among others, and chock-full of two-dimensional caricatures of both artists and critics. It holds no surprises, but with Lee and Gough engaged in a bit of whistling-while-they-work fun, it\u2019s easily the best episode.\n\u201cVampire\u201d feature a young Donald Sutherland who discovers he is married to\u2026 a vampire! It barely raises a pulse.\nSeen today, Dr. Terror\u2019s House of Horrors is more camp than horror, and its appeal is one of genre nostalgia. Still, the phenomenal box office success of Dr. Terror green-lighted a second portmanteau film in 1967, entitled Torture Garden (directed by Freddie Francis and written by Robert Bloch). It contains no torture nor any garden. Burgess Meredith (in a preposterous disguise, reminding us of the Penguin) is Old Nick himself, going by the pseudonym of Dr. Diablo and moonlighting as a carnival barker who promises a tortuous exhibit that can reveal the future. \u201cYou\u2019ll shake, you\u2019ll shiver, but it\u2019s all good fun,\u201d Diablo hammily tells his patrons. Unfortunately, only one of the four tales lives up to that promise.\n\u201cEnoch,\u201d is the opening narrative. Michael Bryant\u2019s inheritance money (from an uncle who took his time dying) is going to be spoiled by a mean ol\u2019 puddy tat with a lot of doubloons.\n\u201cOver Hollywood\u201d has Beverly Adams discovering the fountain of youth in Hollywood with robotic consequences.\n\u201cMr. Steinway\u201d might be seen as a poor precursor to Stephen King\u2019s \u201cChristine,\u201d replacing a killer car with a killer piano. It\u2019s as absurd as it sounds.\nThe first three segments are sloppily written and executed with little enthusiasm; each progressively worse, but the final segment single-handedly salvages the anthology.\n\u201cThe Man Who Collected Poe\u201d finds Jack Palance (playing against type) as an Edgar Allan Poe-obsessed geek who may have found his soulmate in fellow fanatic Peter Cushing. However, somebody\u2019s got something\u2014or someone\u2014hidden in the basement and \u2026 somebody\u2019s got the fever, which leads to a fiery finale. Cushing and Palance clearly enjoyed playing opposite one another and their chemistry, along with clever writing, making one wish the previous segments had been as enjoyable.\n1970\u2019s The House That Dripped Blood (directed by Peter Duffell and written by Robert Bloch) is a considerable improvement over its predecessors. Duffell lacks the visual astuteness of Freddie Francis, but he has superior stories to work with and a top notch cast. The connecting theme is the titular house, which has a bit of baggage left over from all who have resided there.\nIn \u201cMethod For Murder,\u201d Denholm Elliott is a horror author who writes a character that becomes a tad too three-dimensional, much to his wife\u2019s peril.\n\u201cWaxworks\u201d stars Cushing as an uptight retired stockbroker and lifelong bachelor who visits a wax museum, only to see a figure of a woman whom he once was in love with. Obsession and unrequited love naturally go hand-in-hand, or head-on-plate.\nIn \u201cSweets to the Sweet,\u201d Nyree Dawn Porter is hired to tutor a young, motherless child (Chloe Franks) who is unloved by her cold-hearted father, Christopher Lee. Without giving too much away, let\u2019s just say the underlying theme is one few filmmakers would dare tackle today.\n\u201cThe Cloak\u201d is the most famous of the four episodes, remembered fondly for its absurd humor. It stars John Pertwee (best known for his portrayal of Dr. Who) as an actor who mantles the cloak of a purported actual vampire. Hammer favorite Ingrid Pitt bares her fangs and, of course, a bit more.\nAll four episodes feature strong acting, which is a rarity in contemporary horror and should be a model for genre filmmakers. Elliot\u2019s restrained performance in \u201cMethod For Murder\u201d is admirable enough to forgive the predictable \u201ctwist.\u201d The stylish \u201cWaxworks\u201d features an equally stylish performance from Cushing, although narratively it is the thinnest episode. \u201cSweets to the Sweet\u201d is psychologically intense with three powerhouse performances, making it the strongest entry. Although John Pertwee is a bit on-the-sleeve in \u201cThe Cloak,\u201d his performance suits the tone; but, he\u2019s no match for Pitt.\nAsylum (1972, directed by Roy Ward Baker and written by Robert Bloch) is often cited as the best of the Amicus anthologies. It opens on Dr. Martin (Robert Powell, best known as the blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon savior plopped into the Middle East in Franco Zeferelli\u2019s Jesus of Nazareth) showing up for his scheduled job interview with Dr. Starr for a position at the Dunsmoor Asylum. Martin is met by Dr. Rutherford (Patrick Magee), however, and informed that Dr. Starr is now a patient after going insane and becoming violent. Rutherford devises a test for Martin: he will interview four patients and if he can guess which one is Dr. Starr, then he will be hired. Naturally, this segues into four tales from Mr. Bloch.\nIn \u201cFrozen Fear,\u201d Walter (Richard Todd) is having a sordid affair with Bonnie (Barbara Parkins). When his wife Ruth (Sylvia Syms) won\u2019t give him a divorce, Walter grabs an axe and fills his basement freezer with prime ex-wife cold cuts. Little does Walter know that the wifey was a voodoo priestess, and when that freezer thaws, big things come a-crawling in small packages\u2014lots of them. This vignette is the most blatantly indebted to EC comics and, as such, it\u2019s probably Amicus\u2019 finest twenty minutes.\n\u201cThe Weird Tailor\u201d opens with tailor Bruno (Barry Morse) on the verge of being evicted. As luck would have it, Mr. Smith (Peter Cushing) walks into Bruno\u2019s shop and orders a unique suit. With the promise of a hefty commission, Bruno obsessively begins working according to Mr. Smith\u2019s very specific instructions. Unknown to Bruno, the suit is meant to resurrect Mr. Smith\u2019s recently deceased son. Things don\u2019t go according to plan. Previously adapted for Boris Karloff\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d, this one can\u2019t match the TV effort. Given a shorter running time for Asylum, Bloch was forced to excise the prologue, and with it gone, the suspense and menace are diminished. The original thriller was actually more perverse in suggesting Bruno\u2019s wife\u2019s sexual attraction to a mannequin. Additionally, Bruno\u2019s character was less sympathetic, bringing a pronounced, and weird, abusive quality that is merely sketched here. Cushing is superb, bringing a sense of pathos to the character, but his part is little more than a cameo. Being more compressed, the schlock quality of the ending is more pronounced. Yet, for all of its comparative flaws, this is a strong second episode.\n\u201cLucy Comes To Stay\u201d is the weakest of the four episodes. Barbara (Charlotte Rampling) has been released from the asylum to the care of her brother, George (James Valliers) and nurse Higgins (Megs Jenkins). However, Barbara has an imaginary friend named Lucy (Britt Ekland) who doesn\u2019t care for George or the nurse. Lucy is also handy with a knife. Disappointingly, it plays out exactly as expected, and isn\u2019t helped by lackluster performances (Rampling being the exception).\nSurprisingly, \u201cMannequins of Horror\u201d is an extension of the wraparound, with the arrival of a new doctor named Byron (Herbert Lom) who has the demonic hobby of placing spirits within miniature robots and imbuing them with life, which serves as a potential gateway to immortality. Dr. Martin returns to uncover Dr. Starr\u2019s identity in a delightfully unpleasant ending. It\u2019s something of a mini-masterpiece that clearly proved an inspiration to later, albeit inferior films.\nPART TWO will begin with Tales From The Crypt (1972) and take us to the final Amicus anthology: From Beyond The Grave (1974).\nAnthologyChristopher LeeFreddie FrancisHorrorPeter CushingPeter DuffellRoy Ward Baker\nPrevious Post271.

The proposed regulations, when approved, could force automakers to reduce tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. The latter are intimately related to global warming. Parenthetically, the state is aiming to reduce 30 percent of harmful gas emissions by passing stringent auto regulations.\nCalifornia represents about 10 per cent of the overall American auto market. Auto analysts expect that if the proposed regulations are adopted later this year after the review process, it would be the very first limits in the United States regarding auto emissions of gasses linked to global warming. In addition, other states in the nation are expected to follow same regulations to further promote the wellbeing of its citizens and their environment. At least four Northeastern states are observing what California is currently doing.\nThe California Air Resources Board, the one responsible of the proposed regulations, said that the stringent emission regulation is made in response to a state law enacted in 2002. Said law requires automakers to produce cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans that emit 30 per cent less greenhouse gases on average by 2015.\nThe proposed regulations are expected to increase the market value of new vehicles. However, the boards did not go into specifics by divulging the anticipated increase. With the proposed regulations, automotive emission parts are expected to become expensive due to the upgrades and innovations to come up with reduced greenhouse gases emissions. On the one hand, automakers are trying to prevent the proposal from becoming a law. California's actions have tremendous repercussions for the auto industry because the state represents about 10 per cent of the nation's car market.\nThe proposal entails added expenditures to automakers because of the required studies, testing, materials and modifications. Consequently, there is no assurance of a greener pasture attributed to the enhancements of emission control parts.\nThe upgrades needed to meet California's proposed regulations could add thousands of dollars to the price of a new vehicle, said Eron Shosteck of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. \"We are happy to offer these efficient fuel-saving technologies. But consumers just don't want to buy them... Automakers believe consumers should have the option to choose.\" He added that the regulations would result in vehicles that are \"lighter, smaller, less powerful, and less able to do what consumers want.\"\nCalifornia has the dirtiest air in America. This is the very reason why several movements have been established to take care of the matter. In addition to these cause-oriented movements, the state's Air Resources Board is also determined to promote a cleaner air to preclude illness and other hazardous effects of global warming.\nGlobal warming, the continuous increase of Earth's temperature, is said to be mostly attributable to human activities that results to increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, a colorless gas that rises into the atmosphere and traps heat. The situation further leads to warming of the atmosphere by escalating the greenhouse effect.\nGlobal warming influences both the natural environment and human life. Its effects include sea level rise, agricultural repercussions, thinning of the ozone layer, extreme weather events and spread of disease like malaria and other infectious maladies.\nCalifornia officials said automakers could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving gas mileage. Less fuel consumption would result in fewer emissions. They further noted that gas mileage could be improved with available technology, such as high-tech transmissions that shift automatically into the most efficient gear.\nAbout the Author: Joe Thompson is the owner of a successful auto body shop in Ferndale, California.

It passes through some of Switzerland\u2019s most picturesque landscapes and is available for travel in both winter and summer. A train ride through the Swiss Alps is beautiful at any time of the year.\nItalian high-speed trains are booked and have dynamic prices, cheaper in advance than on the day. The reservation opens up to 4 months in advance, depending on the train. Normally, you will need to change trains at least once if you want to travel from Chur to Tirano on these regular local trains.\nAt its highest point, the train is 7392 feet above sea level. You can also book your one-way trip with the Bernina Express and then use the regional trains to reach your next destinations, which would be included in your Swiss Travel Pass. I would also suggest doing this if you plan to get on and off the train. You will have to pay for seats again to return to one of the normal trains, as your tickets will only apply to the panoramic train. It seems that the windows of the normal wagons of the regional train open, but from what I could see, I could not reach those cars from where I was sitting. You can also stop at one of the small towns along the way to get a closer look.\nIn less than four hours, you\u2019ll experience the historic mountain passes of Albula and Bernina, the famous Landwasser Viaduct, with endless views on either side of the train as you twist and turn through the landscape. The 6 limestone arches with the red train, which travel through them, are iconic and became a symbol of scenic train rides in Switzerland and Europe. Shortly after leaving Tirano, the Bernina Express begins to drive through the streets while cars stay at traffic lights, allowing it to pass. The train then climbs up the valley just outside Tirano and continues all the way to the mountainside thousands of meters above sea level. Ospizio Bernina is the summit and highest point of the route at 2,253 meters above sea level.\nTravel with the Bernina Express can also be booked to/from Chur. This sensational scenic drive takes you along some of Switzerland\u2019s most beautiful routes, such as the Golden Pass, Glacier Express, and Bernina Express. In Interlaken you travel to the top of Europe: the Jungfraujoch. Day 2, travel from Zurich to Chur by Swiss InterCity train, then from Chur to Tirano on the fantastic Bernina Express, then Tirano to Milan by regional train trenord, as seen in the previous schedule. You can use the morning train all year round or the evening train in summer. This is the 3-car Allegra unit, coupled with the panoramic cars of the Bernina Express.\nThis is a regional ticket with a fixed price, tickets cannot be sold out, the reservation is not necessary or possible, so you can safely buy close to the departure date, without having to commit your money in advance. In fact, tickets can be purchased at the station on the day itself at this price if you wish. You can avoid paying a reservation fee if you travel in the non-reserved seats on the Allegra unit with the Bernina Express. Since the whole trip only takes 4 hours, you can easily do it in one day.\nThe Express is an hour and a half by train from Zurich and runs all year round. After a break of a few hours, the train departs from Tirano station, making its way through the Treno rosso del Bernina town of Tirano and back along the same route before arriving back in Chur in the late afternoon. The whole trip takes a whole day to complete and can start at both ends.\n2nd Class1st classSingle travel63101Tour116222Sterreservering+10 CHF+ 10 CHFImportantly, as shown in the table, an additional CHF 10 will be charged for seat reservation. These seat reservations can be booked in advance, we recommend this. Booking fees vary depending on the season you are travelling. If you want to travel on the Bernina Express during the cheapest time of the year, we recommend that you travel from November to January/February. It is recommended to reserve a seat if you are travelling during peak hours or want to guarantee a seat on board the daily express trains. You can reserve your seat at a Swiss train station or online.\nTaxis are also not a viable option, as the journey takes several hours. The best way to get from Milan to St. Moritz is via a combination train and bus, which takes about 4.5 hours when all is said and done. You can take a train from Milano Centrale station to Chiavenna, and then change to bus line 4 to St. Moritz Bahnhof. The bus we were travelling in was bad with a clear mechanical problem from the moment we boarded in Milan.\nThey pride themselves on the Bernina Express going from glacial landscapes to palm-friendly climates within hours.

To accelerate progress, President George W. Bush and President Hamid Karzai announced the creation of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council (USAWC) on January 28, 2002.\nThe Council promotes public-private partnerships between U.S. and Afghan institutions and mobilizes private sector resources to help Afghan women. Specifically, the Council seeks to identify concrete actions to bring real and practical benefits to the women of Afghanistan and to enable them to participate and take leadership roles in the political and economic life of their country.\nTo this end, the Council has made education and microfinance its top priorities.\nToo bad - under patriarchy - refuge and shelter has to be the top priority. Battered women's villages - transitional living space free from abuse is the first need. But if you are from the privileged classes, you do not understand the urgency of this need.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4292425.stm\nThe Council meets twice a year, alternating between Kabul and Washington, D.C., to discuss programs and priorities for assisting Afghan women and to review progress.\nUnder Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky co-chairs the Council with the Afghan Foreign Minister and the Afghan Minister of Women's Affairs. What are their names?\nSee http://usawc.state.gov/c10666.htm for more information about Council members.\nTake a look at these people. Not one has ever organized victims of patriarchal violence. They are so removed from that world. They are wealthy. They have fundraising credentials. There is no evaluation or input by feminists who have actually changed resistant, misogynist institutions within the US - civil rights organizers and feminist organizers with track records of success.\nThis is primarily the fault of those organizers who have refused to work with this president even to free their own kind from slavery. Would these modern day feminists have refused to support the abolitionist movement because Lincoln was a Republican? But it is also the fault of this administration who has not appointed any real feminists to the US-Afghan Women's Council to assist in the Middle East efforts.\nThe Council's fifth meeting was held in Washington, DC in the Treaty Room of the White House on June 15, 2004. Members and invited Afghan and American special guests discussed several key issues, including the Afghan national elections, health care, and jobs.\nPresident Bush, President Karzai, Secretary Powell, National Security Advisor Rice, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Thompson met with the group. First Lady Laura Bush honored the Council with a lunch.\nMore than 20 Afghan women attended the meeting and the lunch, including four Afghan Fulbright scholars (a U.S. Department of State educational exchange program), four Afghan women judges on a USAWC training project, and 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture Cochran Fellows in the U.S. for a U.S. Department of Agriculture program for job training in agribusiness.\nThe fourth meeting of the Council was held in Kabul, February 24-26, 2004.\nDiscussions focused on:\neducation, specifically the Teacher Training Institute and Afghan Literacy initiative; microfinance;\nthe new constitution;\nand the elections in Fall 2004.\nThe delegation visited a women's center and met with project managers of programs supported by the U.S. Government and by the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council.\nThe Council's third meeting, in Washington, D.C., July 15-16, 2003, focused on the educational needs of women and girls, job skills training, business development, and the upcoming elections.\nThe delegation met with First Lady Laura Bush and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice at the White House. Secretary Powell hosted a luncheon in their honor.\nAt the Council's second meeting in Kabul, the U.S. announced that it would provide $2.5 million for women's resource centers in 14 of Afghanistan's provinces. The Council also committed $1 million in education and exchange programs for the centers. The centers should include shelters for women who wish to escape abuse and become self sufficient.\nPrograms at these centers focus on basic education literacy, microfinance and small business opportunities, human rights education, and the development and management of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nInaugural Meeting\nThe inaugural meeting took place in Washington, D.C. in April 2002. In response to a request from the Afghan side, the Council later announced its first initiative would bring Afghan women who work in government ministries to the United States for an educational exchange program.\nThe program focused on computer training, leadership, and management training, and other skills vital to their positions.\nPolitical Participation Women's Resource Center.\nUSAID is building 17 Women's Resource Centers in Afghanistan.\nFour centers have been completed and two more are scheduled to finish in the near future.\nThe centers will support outreach, advocacy, and policy formation of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, and create a space in rural provinces for training women in education, health, job skills, leadership, legal awareness, and political participation.\nThrough USWAC women executives of AOL(Time Warner) donated $60,000 for the construction of the resource center in Parwan.\nAfghan Women Leaders Connect (AWLC) ($10,000).\nThis contribution supported a conference in Kabul in Fall 2004 hosted by the Women and Children Legal Research Foundation focusing on legal rights. This is in addition to the Summer 2004 grant of $10,000 that AWLC provided to the International Association of Women Judges to supplement the $75,000 grant by the State Department's International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Bureau, which trained four Afghan women judges in civil and family law.What kind of civil law? Secular? Where is it codified?\nDigital Video Conference.\nThe Council has used digital videoconference (DVC) technology to connect Kabul, Washington, DC and New York, setting up links for discussions and mentoring sessions between women in these cities.\nThe DVC in November 2003 focused on women's political participation in Afghanistan's draft constitution and the Afghan elections in 2004.\nTheDVC in April 2003 focused on the topic of women and business.\nEconomic Opportunities Community Banks.\nThe Council views microcredit as an important means of helping women gain self-sufficiency through starting their own businesses. Through an original $10,000 donation to the Council from Daimler-Chrysler, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), a leading NGO in microfinance, helped start two village banks in Herat.\nDaimler-Chrysler contributed an additional $25,000 in February 2004 to construct another five community banks to support microfinance loans for women in Herat province.\nWith Additional funding from the U.S. Government and other donors, FINCA expects to assist more than 30,000 clients in Afghanistan over the next 5 years.\nU.S. Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs/USAWC Department of State Grants ($750,000).\nFive grants were awarded to organizations for proposals that include:\nbusiness and political leadership training (grant to World Learning);\nentrepreneurship training (grant to Women for Afghan Women);\neducation and literacy training (grants to American Council for International Education and Institute for Training and Development);\nand women's leadership training (grant to University of Delaware).\nSeventy-one women have taken leadership training under the University of Delaware grant thus far.\nThunderbird Graduate School of International Management.\nFifteen Afghan women successfully completed an advanced entrepreneurship training in January 2005. The participants aim to start businesses that would create jobs for women and to serve as mentors/teachers in Afghanistan.\nGlobal Summit of Women ($40,000).\nSupported by USAID, a delegation of nine Afghan women attended the 2004 Global Summit in Seoul, Korea, in May to discuss trade opportunities and receive entrepreneurship training.\nArzu Carpet Initiative ($530,000).\nThis program provides training and literacy skills to Afghan women in the hand-knotted carpet industry. Connie Duckworth, a USAWC member, provided the seed money to get the project started. Arzu placed its first carpet order on International Women's Day (March 8, 2004). The project Arzu (which means \"Hope\" in Dari) not only creates jobs and a cottage industry, it also re-circulates some of its profits to support microcredit initiatives and additional training for women.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Cochran Fellowships.\nTwelve women representing five provinces came to the United States in Spring 2004 for job training as managers and technicians in agribusiness.\nHandicraft Training ($130,000).\nThe Global Summit of Women (July 2002 in Barcelona, Spain) donated approximately $10,000 for job-skills training for women. Through this program, Shuhada, a local organization, is training women in weaving skills. At the conclusion of the program, the women will receive their own looms to produce textiles for market. At the conclusion of the program, the women will receive their own looms to produce textiles for market. This is a big deal. Ever since the film \"Afghan Unveiled\", many people have wanted to get looms to Afghan women living in caves in the Bamiyan geographic location: Herat ? women and children who were living in caves without any source of fuel, nor livestock nor food. Nayak which does have a school for girls, built by American Friends Service Committee, is in central Afghanistan, near Bamiyan.\nIt is unclear from this fact sheet as to whether the Bamiyan women will receive the looms. More info as to how to contact Shuhada or Global Summit of Women directly would be appreciated.\nMedia Women Journalists.\nThe PBS broadcast in November 2004 of the film \"Afghanistan Unveiled\" created an opportunity for mentoring for another Afghan journalist, the fourth that PBS, through USAWC auspices, has trained in the U.S.\nPBS provided modern digital video production and editing equipment for the women video filmmakers to use in Afghanistan and training videos for use at AINA, a Kabul-based NGO devoted to media training.\nThe film \"Afghanistan Unveiled\" for which PBS paid $20,000 in royalties and rights depicts life under the Taliban and the journalist's' journey for the truth. PBS has also optioned the rights for AINA's next film about women's human rights called \"If I Stand Up.\"\nThese films and several short videos to encourage women to vote were made by the \"women's project\" at AINA with Department of State and USAID funding (from Summer 2002 through the October 2004 elections).\nThe Asia Foundation (TAF) was a partner on the original \"Afghanistan Unveiled\" project in 2002 and continues to host trainings and screenings of the film (California, Maryland and Sundance Festivals.)\nHealth Health Advisory Committee.\nOn July 26, 2004 the Council's newly formed Health Advisory Committee sponsored a special session to discuss health issues and create public/private partnerships to utilize resources for greater impact and sustainability.\nUnder Secretary Paula Dobriansky hosted the organizing meeting for the committee.\nMidwife Training. The $5-million Rural Education and Community Health Care Initiative (REACH) provides health-related accelerated learning and basic literacy training for women and girls. Training will take place in the Women's Centers and will target provinces with the highest maternal mortality rates such as Ghazni, Baghlan, and Badakhshan.\nIn April 2004, REACH graduated its first 25 midwives from the program, after they completed an 18-month program in Jalalabad. This pilot program is being replicated across Afghanistan. For each new midwife, the U.S. is supporting a lifetime of lives saved.\nAfghan Family Health Book.\nIn Fall 2004, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tommy Thompson initiated the roll-out of the \"Afghan Family Health Book\" across Afghanistan. This \"talking book\" provides useful and practical information about health practices and hygiene, focusing on health promotion and disease prevention.\nThe books are being distributed via hospitals, clinics, and women's. The project was developed with Leapfrog Enterprises Inc., a developer, designer, and manufacturer of technology-based educational products.\nEducation Fulbright Scholarships.\nFive Afghan women were awarded Fulbright scholarships for the academic year 2004-2005 for advanced graduate-level study in the U.S. Women's Teacher Training Institute ($5 million).\nIn cooperation with USAID, First Lady Laura Bush announced a USAWC Initiative to establish a Women's Teacher Training Institute in Kabul in tandem with The Afghan Literacy Initiative, designed to help teach basic literacy to Afghan women in rural areas of Afghanistan.\nThe Institute opened in September 2004. The Institute's first program, Afghan Literary Initiative for 200 rural villages, is in progress.\nTeacher Training.\nIn 2002, the USAWC initiated a teacher-training exchange to bring 30 Afghan women teachers to Nebraska every six months for training. In turn, these women will train other teachers in Afghanistan.\nAdopt-a-school Program.\nChurch communities in Texas are providing their adopted school with supplies, textbooks, and training.\nU.S. Leadership Management and Computer Education.\nThe Council's first major program, in September and October 2002, brought 14 women from various Afghan government ministries to the United States for an educational exchange program.\nDuring their four-week stay, they received training in computer skills, proposal writing, communications, and leadership management.\nEach participant received a laptop computer to use while training in the United States and to take home to use in Afghanistan.\nThe women met with President George W. Bush and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the White House, and with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at a Department reception held in their honor. They also had the opportunity to interact with senior policymakers, Members of Congress, government agency officials, and representatives of non-governmental organizations.\nIn Austin, Texas, they studied the interaction among federal, state, and local entities.

The defendant was convicted of second-degree attempted murder, first-degree burglary and first-degree robbery.\nThe District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, on September 18, 2013, at about 2 p.m., the victim, Alvita Morales, 75, was in her apartment on Warren Street in the Warren Gardens/Wycoff Housing Development, when she heard a knock on the door and looked through the peephole.

He then rifled through her belongings, stopping to check on her before leaving the apartment.

His ability to go beyond the nuts and bolts of a particular proposal and identify the way it folds into the manner in which Washington does business as well as ferret out the hidden games and agendas is unmatched. That\u2019s why you should read his latest post on the President\u2019s new budget proposal.\nWhen you do take a look at it pay particular attention to the section the debt trigger that Mr. Obama is putting forth. This is the fail-safe device which will presumably save us when the parties are unable to come to any sort of agreement. I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it during the speech but it popped up this morning in a post by Ezra Klein and I\u2019m beginning to wonder if this isn\u2019t a key goal. Here\u2019s Klein on the trigger:\nWhether you assume we have till mid-May or early June, that\u2019s not enough time for Republicans to rethink their position on taxes and nor for Democrats to come around to privatizing Medicare. So there\u2019s going to have to be some placeholder attached to the debt ceiling vote. The \u2018trigger\u2019 attached to Obama\u2019s budget is a likely candidate. If we\u2019re not on a better fiscal path come 2014, it begins indiscriminately slicing away at a large swath of the federal budget and, importantly, at tax expenditures. So, in theory at least, it puts us on the path to deficit reduction without requiring us to make the hard decisions of deficit reduction right this minute. That\u2019s probably the likeliest immediate outcome of all of these plans and proposals.\nGot that? No agreement on anyone\u2019s plan by the time we get to the debt ceiling drop dead date so both sides agree to the trigger mechanism. Presumably we fight this through the election and barring some huge mandate for change one way or the other, go back to fighting about the same subject in 2013 and assuming no compromise rely on the trigger to do the dirty work.\nAs Hennessey points out, there is a rather large bias in the trigger:\nThe President\u2019s proposal is similar to past triggers in that it exempts all discretionary spending, Social Security, and interest on the debt. While past triggers limited the amounts that Medicare and Medicaid could be cut, the President\u2019s trigger appears to exempt them entirely. The White House fact sheet says the trigger \u201cshould not apply to Social Security, low-income programs, or Medicare benefits.\u201d Elsewhere it says the trigger applies only to mandatory spending.\nAssuming that \u201clow-income programs\u201d includes Medicaid, this means the trigger appears to apply to at most about $300 B (if triggered this year) in \u201cother mandatory\u201d spending. Half of that would hit federal retiree payments, a quarter would hit veterans\u2019 benefits (if not defined as \u201clow income\u201d), and the rest would hit smaller things like farm subsidies.\nIt therefore appears that the President\u2019s trigger would exempt more than 90% of government spending from the automatic across-the-board cut.\nThe trigger would also raise taxes by implementing \u201cacross-the-board spending reductions \u2026 [in] spending through the tax code.\u201d In other words, the trigger would somehow (how??) automatically reduce tax expenditures across-the-board (rather than raising rates, it appears). No past trigger has included a tax increase. This is new.\nThe fog lifts. The across-the-board trigger would apply to less than 10% of federal spending and would also raise taxes. And since it would apply only to itemized deductions, it\u2019s only going to hit a portion of those paying income taxes, which is only a portion of all Americans.\nThe trigger is, in effect, a tax increase trigger on those who itemize deductions, with a little other mandatory spending thrown in for good measure.\nThe overwhelming impact of the trigger would be to raise taxes on those who itemize. A much smaller portion of triggered deficit reduction would come from automatic spending cuts.\nWhen you combine the automatic nature of this policy with the absence of specific policies needed to sufficiently reduce spending in the long run, the effect of this trigger would be to shift the burden of future entitlement spending increases away from deficits and onto higher income taxpayers. The future default would be that entitlement spending would grow at an unsustainable rate, and taxes on \u201cthe rich\u201d would grow to hold deficits below 3% of GDP.\nHe notes correctly that structured as it appears to be, the trigger rewards those who favor increased spending financed by higher taxes to stonewall on budget cuts.\nKeep an eye on this particular feature of the President\u2019s proposal. If it does end up as a compromise feature of a debt ceiling increase, you can expect the Democrats to go into full stall mode. Assuming the President is reelected, they can continue to fight any significant spending cuts, justifying their actions by pointing to the trigger as the mechanism which will mediate irreconcilable differences.\nApril 13, 2011 Obama Delivers A Political Speech Not A Plan (74)\nApril 10, 2013 Budget Battles (0)\nMarch 7, 2009 Is Obama A Radical?

Diccon Bewes is a British travel writer who lives in Switzerland, and during research he came across a diary from a young Englishwoman, Jemima Morrell, who, as part of a group who called themselves the Junior United Alpine Club, travelled on the very first Thomas Cook tour to Switzerland in 1863. The group consisted of four young women and three young men, and included Jemima's brother William, who paid for both of them.\nBewes determined to follow as much as possible in her footsteps, following the route she took, staying in the same places and visiting the same sights as much as possible. Near the beginning of the book is a map of the Cook tour from 1863 which took place from June 26th to July 15th, and included travel by rail, diligence, foot, mule, and steamship. With Thomas Cook the company that launched modern mass tourism, and by the time I finished the book going into bankruptcy, this book looks at travel from an interesting vantage point. Bewes took the trip with his mother, going back to certain points at a later date on his own.\nAppendices include: a brief description of the world in 1863, and a timeline of that year showing some important events that occured; a summary, including data points of Switzerland in the 1860s with information on language spoken, size of towns, birth and death rates, wages and prices, and occupations; and descriptions and explanations on money of the time, both English and Swiss their modern equivalencies.\nAs he followed Jemima's journey, he and his mother read sections from the diary at each point in their journey, and while many of the lodgings that she stayed in no longer existed, a few did. Some sections of the journey are now done by train, where there weren't trains back then, and Jemima's journey definitely involved longer and more difficult travel times. Some of her days were exceedingly long, and many of the places she stayed didn't offer the modern conveniences now available.\nDewes shows the differences between the two experiences plainly, from the modes of travel, to the the time travelling took, to the things one was able to see at each point in the journey. He shows the huge changes that have taken place in the tourism industry in Switzerland, and talks about the drivers of those changes. He discusses changes to the physical environment, from the buildings and food on offer to the shrinking of the snow caps and glaciers. He follows up at the end with a look at what became of Jemima after this journey and the discovery of a personal connection to her family.\nThis was a fascinating and educational read, and hugely entertaining.\nLabels: History, Journeys, Memoirs, Switzerland, Travel, Writers\nNutcracker Night\nTears of Salt\nTriceratops Stomp\nThe Castle in the Sea\nThe Corner That Held Them\nMy Drowning\nA Better Man\nMurder in Passy\nBody Bereft\nMrs. Saint and the Defectives\n13th Canadian Book Challenge October Roundup", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 301, "original_length": 32561, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.98, "perplexity": 258.6, "bucket": "head"}

Bank credit grew at 12.64 percent year-on-year to Rs 85.511 lakh crore (US$ 1,326.78 billion) on May 11, 2018, from Rs. 75.91 lakh crore (US$ 1,131.47) on May 12, 2017.\nThe bank recapitalization plan by Government of India is expected to push credit growth in the country to 15 percent and as a result, help the GDP grow by 7 percent in FY19. Enhanced spending on infrastructure, speedy implementation of projects and continuation of reforms are expected to provide further impetus to growth. All these factors suggest that India\u2019s banking sector is also poised for robust growth as the rapidly growing business would turn to banks for their credit needs.\nNBFC Regulations: Evolution, rationalization & challenges ahead\nSpeaker: Mr. Shivaji Dhekane | Deputy Vice President - Analytics, Tata Capital\nNon-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are companies engaged in the business of loans and advances that form an important and integral part of the Indian financial system. They play an important role in nation building and financial inclusion by complementing the commercial banking sector in making credit available to the unbanked segments of society, especially to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for the majority of non-agricultural employment in the country. In terms of financial assets, NBFCs have recorded a healthy growth of 19% CAGR over the past few years and its share in total credit is expected to grow to 20% by 2020 from 13% in 2015.\nWith the growing importance of data-driven decisions, technology can enable NBFCs to more efficiently serve their customers. Some of the applications include lending based on data from mobile phone records, the rise of social media scoring, assessing of the customer\u2019s propensity to repay the loans. These are also referred to as alternative data scoring.\nNBFCs can realize the potential value of alternative data by making investments in technology and analytics to leverage both traditional and non-traditional data sources. This will enable a healthy competition, increase product innovation, and also further the government goal of increasing financial inclusion.\nChallenges still exist for NBFCs as the financial sector sees a rapid transformation. Owing to the lighter regulations on NBFCs, globally they have been seen to take up high leverage and sub-credit assets thus risking the health of their assets. Another issue is with respect to the convergence of the regulations of banks and NBFCs. Though it has improved in the recent iterations to regulations, further convergence is desired. The NBFCs act as a catalyst to the development of the country and is therefore important to nurture and actively manage their health.\nRedefining the lines: Growing influence of FinTechs on Indian Financial services and the challenges\nSpeaker: Mr. Nayan Mehta | Chief Financial Officer, Bombay Stock Exchange\nFintech refers to financial technology that describes an emerging financial services sector in the 21st century. Originally, the term applied to technology applied to the back-end of established consumer and trade financial institutions. Since the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the term has expanded to include any technological innovation in the financial sector, including innovations in financial literacy and education, retail banking, investment and even crypto-currencies like bitcoin.\nSince the internet revolution and the mobile internet revolution, however, financial technology has grown explosively, and fintech, which originally referred to computer technology applied to the back office of banks or trading firms, now describes a broad variety of technological interventions into personal and commercial finance. According to EY, Fintech Adoption Index, one-third of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services and those consumers are also increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives.\nTrends in Digital Lending\nSpeaker: Mr. Ashish Desai| Senior Vice President and Head - Product and Payments, Aditya Birla Payments Bank\nDigital Lending enables borrowers to apply for any consumer or business lending product (credit card, line of credit, mortgage, business loan) 24x7 from any internet connected device, at any location, any time of the day. The aim is to make lending fully digital across channels and mobile devices.\nDigital lending targets to transform inefficient and lengthy loan and mortgage origination processes into a fully digital, paperless, risk-conscious and customer-oriented experience streamlining tasks and operations for realtors, partners, brokers, agents, branch employees, specialists and back office users across any type of device.\nThe Changes in the mutual fund industry, from a regulatory standpoint, in the recent past and its impact on the industry\nSpeaker: Mr. Nitish Sikand| Executive Vice President and Fund Manager \u2013 Fixed Income at Invesco Mutual Fund\nIn the aftermath of the 2007-08 financial crises, the regulations in the financial services industry have increased many folds. In India, SEBI has also introduced a couple of initiatives to protect the investor\u2019s interest that on the other hands can be considered as anti-industry.\nEntry Load Ban: In August 2009, SEBI banned the charge of entry loads on investors thereby decreasing distributors margins.\nIntroduction of Uniform factsheets: In Sep 2015, SEBI directed mutual fund houses to standardize their fact sheets with the aim to prevent investors from taking unwarranted risks.\nColour coding to risk-o-meter: In 2013, SEBI made it mandatory for the mutual fund houses to use product labels with color codes to help investors assess the risk involved while investing in a respective mutual fund scheme.\nIntroduction of Direct Plans: The rationale behind introducing the direct plans was to reduce the role of distributors in increasing the retail participation. If investors approach mutual funds directly to transact, the fund houses would be able to cut off the long chain of distributors and agents who have always added to their cost structure.\nMandatory disclosure of commission (in the account statement) paid to distributors: As directed by SEBI, fund houses will now have to disclose the commissions they pay to distributors, in Rupee terms, for the businesses solicited.\nIndian Mutual Fund Industry: Challenging the status quo and setting the growth path\nSpeaker: Mr. Ashish Jain| Head of Fund Services\u2013Deutsche Bank\nThe asset management industry has grown enormously in the last couple of decades with the AUM increasing 20 times from 47,000 crores in 1994 to 8.25 Lakh crores in 2014. At the same time, the industry expanded rapidly in terms of no. of companies, products, schemes. The industry is still very young and has huge opportunity to grow. But, despite this tremendous growth, the industry is still not able to free itself from the constraints and faces some challenges that needs to be discussed and tackled to create a path for growth for the industry for it to reach its true potential. The share of asset management industry has remained very low in the total household savings, garnering lesser than 3% from the total household savings. It is neither growing in a desirable pace. Even after being a consistent provider of inflation beating return, the industry is outpaced by other investment alternatives like Gold, Real Estate etc.\nThe asset management industry need to challenge its status quo and provide products for the needs of varied investors. This way the industry will be able to increase the volume and create greater return for all the stakeholders. It need to observe the global trends and take cue from them for providing wider product basket. If only these challenges are tackled, the industry will grow to its true potential.\nLatest trends in passive investments and overview on the debate about active v/s passive investments\nSpeaker: Mr. Anil Ghelani | Head of Passive Investments & Products \u2013 DSP BlackRock\nPassive investing has changed globally, driving costs down for mom-and-pop investors. However, mostly ETF (exchange-traded funds) is the passive investment strategy that is trending in the market and is one of the trusted investment vehicles for a broad range of institutional and individual investors. These came into the picture around 30 years ago, ETFs now manage roughly $4 trillion in assets globally which is less than the amount invested in open-end mutual funds (actively managed and indexed). Most market analysts expect assets in ETFs to outperform mutual funds within a few years, based on the current investing trend.\nPassive investing, sometimes called index investing, is a strategy that tries to replicate the returns from whatever index it tracks. That may be the FTSE 100 Index or something less well known. These days there are many passive funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) available to investors. Passive investments are popular with those who believe in active management to be unreliable and expensive. Instead, the passive investor is happy to accept market returns in exchange for the peace of mind that nobody is overcharging and returns are unlikely to seriously under perform the market.\nEven passive funds have some charges, so returns are virtually guaranteed to be a little lower than those of the index itself. Active investors are not prepared to accept average market returns and want to beat the market. They know they will have to pay higher fees to do so but this is balanced by the possibility of higher returns. There has long been a debate between supporters of active and passive investments as to which is better.\nTransformation Imperatives for a Global Bank\nSpeaker: Mr. Yatish Shivaprasad | Senior Vice President- Societe Generale GSC\nBanks are investing in the short-term on cloud computing and FinTech collaboration, and longer-term on blockchain and AI technologies, as part of a digitalisation drive. Digital disruption has the potential to shrink the role and relevance of today\u2019s banks, and simultaneously help them create better, faster, cheaper services that make them an even more essential part of everyday life for institutions and individuals.\nWhen it comes to regulation, international standards are set by bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Union. After the 2008 crisis, regulators had proposed significant solutions to the crash. Ten years after the global financial crisis, the banking industry has regained its health and the mood of bankers is more buoyant.\nIndian credit landscape and emerging trends in Retail Lending\nSpeaker: Mr. Amol Deherkar| Head of Corporate planning and strategy \u2013 Retail finance at Edelweiss\nRetail banking in India is not a new phenomenon. It has always been prevalent in India in various forms. For the last few years it has become synonymous with mainstream banking for many banks. The typical products offered in the Indian retail banking segment are housing loans, consumption loans for purchase of durables, auto loans, credit cards and educational loans. The loans are marketed under attractive brand names to differentiate the products offered by different banks. India\u2019s retail banking now bigger than Russia but not close to China.\nThe growth of retail lending, especially, in emerging economies, is attributable to the rapid advances in information technology, the evolving macroeconomic environment, financial market reform, and several micro-level demand and supply side factors. Demand has grown for both corporate &amp; retail loans; particularly the services, real estate, consumer durables &amp; agriculture allied sectors have led the growth in credit. India registered a record inflow of amount of US$ 51.02 billion in mutual funds in FY 2016-17. According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data, this was the highest investment in mutual fund schemes since the fiscal 1999-2000.", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 166, "original_length": 15443, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.94, "perplexity": 328.4, "bucket": "head"}

Mine expired in 2013, and thinking back to the process back in 2003, I don\u2019t remember it being so bad. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the picture I had in the latest iteration of my passport, mainly because I decided to get it taken 2 days after I started a fitness plan, but I digress.\nIt was pretty easy to find and complete the forms for renewal online. The only snafu there was that it didn\u2019t fully print the address for my emergency contact, but that was easy enough to write in.\nSo we took our completed forms, old passports, and $110 checks made out to the \u201cDepartment of State\u201d and headed over to the Colonie Center post office to have our pictures taken and to send everything in. When we arrived, there was a sign indicating the passport picture machine being out of service and diverting people to a place inside of the mall called \u201cI Smile Studio\u201d for this service.\nNow, I understand shit happens. Things break. Kids pick up cameras and yank the film out of them all the time (well, they did 20 years ago). I know all that jazz. I also understand that lots of places take passport photos, but in the heat of the moment, you\u2019re in the zone and just want to accomplish the task at hand. So I was annoyed that the only passport office with hours outside of normal business hours for miles couldn\u2019t have their shit together for what would be a busy day. It was a minor annoyance; they offered a plan B that seemed easy enough.\nSo we found this I Smile Studio and were quickly greeted and served. $16 a piece for 6 identical passport pictures. I don\u2019t know the market for this; it seemed high, but I just wanted to get it done. A young lady helped us step around the seemingly countless parents and children lining up for pictures with Santa and other fictional and non-fictional nouns. She put us in front of a white background and took a couple of pictures. She said it would take 15 minutes or so to print and cut the pictures.\nWe waited the 15 minutes, and a different girl called us over and said they needed to retake the pictures, no explanation as to why, but we followed. After waiting another 20 minutes, a different girl came out to ask if we were waiting to have our passport pictures taken. At this point I was pretty frustrated. I explained that they had taken the pictures twice and that we had no idea what was going on. She walked in the back and came back out to argue with me that they needed to take our pictures again.\nAt this point, I wanted to know what was going on. The young lady really didn\u2019t offer up more information other than the fact that the pictures needed to be retaken. A different lady came out with an envelope containing my wife\u2019s pictures and had my pictures in her hand. She showed them to me and said the background in the first picture they took came out a little too grey. I argued that in 2014, changing grey to white on a digital image is easy (I can even do it!). She then explained that the second picture they took of me didn\u2019t show up on the memory card.\nSo I obliged to a third picture.\nNoticing I was pretty visibly upset and a tad argumentative, she had refunded the fee, which was a nice gesture, but I\u2019m more comfortable paying for and receiving a professional service the first or second time.\nThe resulting image still had a grey background, and I definitely saw the manager adjust the contrast to make it less grey before printing, but I had a picture and was ready to go back to the post office to finish this stupidity.\nSo I have a passport photo. My feelings about it are in a superposition of quantum states between \u201clove it\u201d and \u201chate it\u201d. But it might actually be what I send out as a holiday card this year.\nThere were only two people working the counter at the post office, and it seemed that only one could process passport applications, so the wait was long. While I was on the line, I was fidgeting with the pen they had attached to the table.\nNot for nothing, I am in a good financial position and don\u2019t need to take the crappy pen from the counter of a terrible post office, but I could totally have walked off with that stupid pen. If you\u2019re gonna pin it to the table, don\u2019t put the joint of the ball chain on the pen. That\u2019s just dumb and asking for trouble.\nI think we spent almost 2 hours, and I learned nothing from the exercise.\nBut I\u2019m going to Mexico!!!\nAnnoying Awkward Capital Region", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 52, "original_length": 7982, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.98, "perplexity": 273.4, "bucket": "head"}

Monn\nNEW YORK--There was a celebratory mood as Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre held a seven- performance, five day engagement at Lincoln Center, its first in that eponymous arts center in more than a decade. The venue has particular significance, not only to Ailey fans, but to the organization's new artistic director, Robert Battle, who first laid eyes upon its grand facades and plaza as a student at the Julliard School. \"I know this is our first time in Lincoln Center in a while, but C'mon!\" Battle gently chided the crowd, who were perhaps overwhelmed by the grand surroundings. It wasn't long before they broke out in foot-stomping, shouts and applause as the company members pranced on stage to the Afro-centric rhythms and moves of Jamaican-born choreographer Garth Fagan's electrifying From Before, a pastiche of African polyrhythms, Caribbean dance, precision ballet and street hip hop that set the audience on its collective ear. The Ailey Company premiere is the first time this dizzying work from the Tony Award winning choreographer for The Lion King has ever been performed by a company other than Garth Fagan Dance. The fluid, acrobatic movements of the dancers was mesmerizing. At times, the repetitious movements took on an hypnotic characteristic, which, at times seemed monotonous to the untrained eye. To those familiar with the well-spring of Caribbean and African tradition from which mark Fagan's oeuvre', the repetitive nature of the dance is a vital part of its almost ritualistic roots in Afro-Caribbean tradition and culture. The jazzy percusive score by Trinidadian Grammy winner Ralph MacDonald and colorful costumes by the choreographer himself and Original Lighting by C.T. Oakes made for a perfect eye-popping opening statement for the evening and painted a clear picture of the company's new direction and renewed vitality under Mr. Battle. Now in his second season as Artistic Director, he has stepped from beneath the long shadows of founder, Alvin Ailey and Artistic Director Emerita, Judith Jamison, to give the company his own unique stamp.\nThe kinetic energy of dancer Yannick Lebrun filled the stage in Takademe, choreographed by Mr. Battle with propulsive electronic music by Sheila Chandra. One of his first creations, Mr. Battle's Takademe combines the taut rhythms and deconstructed moves of Indian Kathank dance with the fast-paced polyrhythms of Chandra's New Age jazz score. The music is layered with vocalized symbols that at times mimic the 'click' songs of the Tsosa tribe of South Africa. Lebrun's quick, almost superhuman leaps, thrusts and acrobatic flips were almost exhaustive to behold. The sheer dynamic of his scissoring jumps, torso contractions and deep-bending stomps occurred in such rapid succession that it was difficult for the mind to assimilate them as quickly as the eye could see them. Grace, Ronald K. Brown's landmark creation for the company in 1999 was brought back in a dazzling new production that show the best of what the 'new' Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre is all about. Combining West African dance idioms with elements of Afro-Pop and modern dance, the work began with Duke Ellington's classic Come Sunday, followed by Roy Davis's Gospel hit Gabriel concluding with Fela Kuti's James Brown-inspired Afro-Pop music. Grace promotes the very contemporary idea, through motion, that we are all somehow touched by spiritual grace and the healing power and reach of the soul as we travail through the various ups and downs of our day to day lives. Revelations, which ended every performance during the five-evening run, is a loving tribute to the company's founder, Alvin Ailey. Created by Ailey in 1960 to spotlight the illustrious dancing of the company's principal dancer and now Artistic Director Emerita Judith Jamison, it is at once a recreation of a landmark event in the world of modern dance and a touchtone to what is a living memorial to Mr. Ailey and his vision. Set against recordings of Traditional Black Church music, Ailey's masterpiece was intended to give the audience a glimpse into his remembrances of the Baptist Church services attended as a child in rural Texas. Infused with the soul-stirring emotions of youthful religious fervor and later superimposed with the writings of African American authors James Baldwin and Langston Hughes and even later influences of Brueghal paintings and Oriental Theatre, Revelations still has the power to inspire. An elderly woman seated next to me, accompanied by her daughter, was moved to tears, as were many others. Youngsters, who had been brought to the performance by their parents, seemed transfixed by its power and majesty.\nOther notable works from the long weekend's performances included Four Corners,a World Premiere by celebrated choreographer and Ailey favorite Ronald K. Brown and Petit Mort, a really superb example of the company's mastery of classic ballet forms and the technical prowess and almost overwhelming sensuality of Alvin Ailey's unique brand of dance technique. Petit Mort, choreographed by renowned European dance master Jiri Kylian and set against the music of Woflgang Amadeus Mozart's two most popular piano concertoes, really showcases the company's towering capabilities and showed why the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre is one of the most in-demand companies performing today. The company is celebrated globally and is designated \"A vital American cultural ambassador to the world\" by a 2008 U.S. Congressional resolution. This summer, the company prepares for a fall tour of Brazil and Argentina and will be conducting numerous education and performance programs at its world headquarters at the Joan Weill Center for Dance in Manhattan, the city's largest building solely dedicated to dance. The building, designed by Bibliowicz Architects, is home to The Company as well as Ailey II, which performs in the Chicago area Friday, October 25 in two performances at Governors State University at The Center for Performing Arts in south suburban University Park, Illinois. For advance tickets and information, visit alvinailey.org or call 708-235-2222. Also this summer, The Company will operate AileyCamp, a unique program that combines dance classes with personal development workshops, creative communications classes and field trips for under-served youth aged 11-14 in cities such as Atlanta, Miami, FL, Berkeley/Oakland, California, Kansas City, KS and MO Bridgeport, CT and New York City. In addition the company will be hosting world-wide auditions at its headquarters in New York and in Bari, Italy in the Puglia region. The Ailey School continues, educating more than 5,000 students of all ages throughout the year with Arts in Education and Community Programs being simultaneously held by The Ailey Organization in classrooms and community centers, bringing dance into the lives of more than 100,000 people of diverse backgrounds around the country and around the world. This was the vision of Alvin Ailey, born January 5, 1931 in Rogers, Texas. He founded the company in 1958 with the idea of enriching American modern dance heritage with the uniqueness of the African-American cultural experience. His untimely death in 1989, did nothing to dim that vision. As evidenced at Lincoln Center, it lives on in the dancers who are the apostles to\nhis cultural movement and in the souls of audience members who witness his genius onstage.\nPosted by Dwight the Connoisseur at 12:58\u202fPM\nNew York Philharmonic Concerts in the Parks-Summe...\nA Fabulous Fourth-New York Style!\nNew York Philharmonic A Dancer's Dream Gets Everyo...\nABT's Sylvia Showcases Dazzling Principal Dancers...\nAlvin Ailey American Dance Theatre is Reborn in Li...", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 147, "original_length": 11153, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.96, "perplexity": 255.1, "bucket": "head"}

But it wasn't clear if autism developed before eating disorders or vice versa.\nTo find out, researchers assessed autism traits in nearly 5,400 children in the United Kingdom at ages 7, 11, 14 and 16, and signs of eating disorders (such as fasting, purging, prolonged dieting or binge-eating) at age 14.\nThe research team found that autism traits appeared first, suggesting that it may be a risk factor for eating disorders, according to the study published online recently in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.\nChildren with more autism traits at age 7 were 24% more likely to have weekly signs of disordered eating at age 14. However, eating disorders at age 14 did not appear to increase autism traits by age 16, the investigators found.\n\"The next step is to learn more about why those with autistic traits have a higher risk of developing an eating disorder so we can then design interventions to prevent eating disorders,\" said study co-author William Mandy. He's a senior lecturer in health education and psychology at University College London (UCL).\n\"Around a fifth of women presenting with anorexia nervosa have high levels of autistic traits -- and there is some evidence that these women benefit the least from current eating disorder treatment models. People with autism and eating disorders may need a different approach towards treatment,\" Mandy said in a university news release.\nSenior study author Glyn Lewis, a professor of epidemiological psychology at UCL, said parents and caregivers of children with autism should be aware of the risks. \"Being alert to eating disordered behaviors and seeking help early could be helpful,\" Lewis noted.\nThe U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on eating disorders.\nSOURCE: University College London, news release, May 12, 2020\nHelping Your Teen Manage Asthma\nAutism Quiz\nEating Disorders Quiz\nAn Eating Disorder's Legacy: Stopping the Cycle", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 429, "original_length": 11689, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.96, "perplexity": 250.1, "bucket": "head"}

On the one hand, the Bible tells us to to obey governing authorities (1 Peter 2; Romans 13). On the other hand, there are examples of apparent justified law-breaking (Esther 4; Daniel 1, 3, 6; Acts 5:29).\nOccasionally, Christians are obliged to break the law. When the law asks us to perform acts contrary to the explicit command of God, we are obliged to obey God. For example, Christians are obliged to disobey any prescription to refrain from worship of God. We are also obligated to explain the gospel to people (sometimes this gets us arrested). According to Martin Luther King, Christians ought to disobey unjust laws such as segregation laws:\n\u201cThere are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \u2018an unjust law is no law at all.\u2019\u201d\nKing appealed to a universal natural law to make his case. Just laws are only laws that are in accord with the moral law of God: \u201cA just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law of the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law.\u201d\nAccording to King, breaking of unjust laws can be morally permissible (obviously not legally permissible) only if the person does it (i) \u201copenly, (ii) lovingly, and (iii) with a willingness to accept the penalty.\u201d MLK appeals to the case of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who broke the unjust law to bow to Nebuchadnezzar. He also cites cases of Martyrs under Roman persecution, Socrates in Athens, the Boston Tea Party, those who hid Jewish people in Hitler\u2019s Germany, and disobedience in communist countries.\nThe purpose of direct action is \u201cto create such a crisis and foster such a tension that community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.\u201d In the same way Socrates created tension to lead people to a higher state of knowledge, direct action creates tension sufficient for removing racism. The outcome should be negotiation.\nIn Ethics for a Brave New World (p.724-732), John Feinberg and Paul Feinberg, Christians only have a moral obligation to disobey the law when the law asks them to perform an act contrary to the revealed will of God. If you cannot obey both God\u2019s command and a human law, then the Christian must obey God\u2019s law. Since the Christian is under an obligation to obey God, she is obligated to disobey the human authority when it is in direct conflict with God\u2019s commands.\nBut what should Christians do when there is a law that permits immoral actions but does not command them to act against God\u2019s commands. Christians are often opposed to laws which permit certain immoral actions to take place in society. In most cases, Christians do not seek legislation to restrict immoral activities (nor do they think they ought to). But in other cases, Christians seek legislation to prohibit immoral actions. For example, abortion and infanticide are clearly against the command of God. They are also the kinds of actions against which there ought to be laws. Yet abortion legally permitted and it appears that some think infanticide is not wrong. In these cases, Christians are not obliged to disobey any laws and they should not break good laws in order to protest bad ones. Damaging property or murdering people to protest abortion laws is not right. Instead, protests that do not break good laws are permitted. This is what we have been doing up to now.\nHowever, the recent legislation passed in New York and the United States\u2019 Senate\u2019s refusal to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act has led many to wonder if we can do more than march and argue. But since there is no law to break, there is no way to raise the issue beyond persuasion and demonstration.\nOne suggestion that may gain traction is state disobedience. A pro-life state could defy a federal or court ruling against one of its laws. If a state legislature passed an outright ban on abortions, then the federal government would step in and overturn it. The courts would rule against it. The state could defy all of these rulings thus setting up a form of disobedience. Presently, some states defy federal law on marijuana, immigration policy, and a host of other issues. However, attempts to restrict abortion in states have been successfully blocked in court. My question is: might we ask a state to hold the line \u2013 to defy the court\u2019s order? It might cost every official his/her job. It may require that state to take the brunt of economic and media sanctions. Who knows? But it might also do what King did through his civil disobedience \u2013 it may result in justice.\nWhat do you think? Are there good reasons not to advocate for this?\nIf Rights, Then God.\nHard Work Does Not Always Pay\nOn Desire", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 77, "original_length": 7021, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.96, "perplexity": 293.5, "bucket": "head"}

Health On the Net Foundation's origins go back to the September 1995 meeting on the Use of the Internet and World-Wide Web for Telematics in Healthcare, when some of the world's foremost experts on telemedicine gathered in Geneva, Switzerland. The visionary experts who created HON anticipated the need for trustworthy health information online.\nThus, HON was created to promote the deployment of useful and reliable health information online and to enable its appropriate and efficient use. Two decades on, the HONcode is the oldest and most valued quality marker for online health information. It is a pragmatic solution that has been adopted by more than 8,000 websites. HON is a not-for-profit international foundation and non-governmental organization.\nAt HON, we work to develop realistic and applicable solutions related to our mission: \u201cto promote the effective and reliable use of the new technologies for telemedicine in healthcare around the world.\u201d Over the past two decades, we have identified two main challenges for which we develop schemes, conduct research activities to use on pragmatic and concrete services, and collaborate with other entities on multiple projects:\nhow to discern reliable health content;\nhow to provide access to trustworthy resources.\nHON has been granted consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC). This status facilitates relations with United Nations bodies, including special relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), and reinforces our consultative role with government ministries in several countries where HON has contacts.\nHON also holds the status of \u201cLiaison A\u201d to the Health Informatics Technical Committee (ISO/TC 215) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

However, this issue is not limited to Rwanda. Construction works are considered risky, with regular and high accident rates and ill-health problems for workers, practitioners, and end users. Health and safety issues have always been a significant problem and concern in the construction industry. Workers are exposed to occupational diseases and injuries hazards and the adverse effects of excessively long work hours. Machines, plants and other sophisticated construction equipment pose a danger to the operators, who in most cases do not have prior skills for operating such machines or plants. The number of occupational injuries in the construction industry in Rwanda is high and has kept increasing despite the existing structures there; for safety and health management on construction sites. From this perspective, this study aimed to investigate the health and safety performance of construction projects in Rwanda. An overview of published research and legislation was undertaken. In order to meet the objectives of the study, questionnaires were designed and distributed to potential construction industry players. Structured interviews were carried out with selected government officials in charge of occupational health and safety and construction experts from a selection of large to medium construction sites. After analysis of the results, the study recommends the provision and use of PPE for all workers and, at all times, the launch of education campaigns to arouse awareness among all management and construction workers and more diligent OSH precautions by site staff and provisions at the corporate level. Additionally, adequate staffing of the OSH department and formulation of a more effective OSH framework (of policies, laws, and institutions) at the national level should create a more enabling environment for high OSH performance in the construction industry of Rwanda. This study aimed to bring about awareness of the risks faced by construction workers in Rwanda. The study also provided practical information which will facilitate all the construction stakeholders in enhancing safety on the construction sites.\nMaster of Science in Construction Project Management\nName: PIUS TUKESIGA - ...", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 48, "original_length": 3522, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.94, "perplexity": 263.0, "bucket": "head"}

What\u2019s the deal? I\u2019ve always parked closer, even for sold-out shows. I don\u2019t know if last night\u2019s Yeah Yeah Yeahs Yeahs show was a sell out or not, but I\u2019ve never seen it so packed in the auditorium before. I got there at 10, just in time for the Yeahs\u2019 set. On the back of the stage hung a huge Show Your Bones scrim, red and black like a giant flag representing the United States of Yeahs. With no fanfare at all, on walked the band, including a fourth guy who played acoustic guitar, keyboards and, on one song, bass! So here were the Yeahs with added fire power, and despite that, they sounded less epic than they did when I saw them as a trio two years ago, back when the show was literally a showcase for Nick Zinner\u2019s blowtorch guitarwork. Maybe it was the fact that I was sandwiched in the very back of the hall, but Zinner\u2019s guitar sounded buried in the mix, tucked away somewhere beneath Karen O\u2019s vocals and the rest of the cacophony. Overall, a lackluster show. I blame their new record, which is less inventive and interesting than Fever to Tell (or maybe I\u2019m just getting too familiar with the formula). With Nick in the background, O\u2019s theatrical prancing took center stage. Dressed in a red-and-black jumper and wearing one glittering glove on her right hand, she looked and sounded like a cross between a bobbed Chrissie Hynde and a modern-day Wicked Witch of the West. I never heard her once address the audience, instead blowing through the set of new songs non-stop. The crowd didn\u2019t seem to care, though. They were too busy doing a modified pogo and flashing devil horns. After 45 minutes, I figured I\u2019d seen enough and high-tailed it down to the Underground. I\u2019m told that shortly after I left the band kicked off a three-song encore that included the night\u2019s best performance.\nMeanwhile, downstairs, a hip-hop show was in high gear. Here\u2019s where anyone with even a surface knowledge of the genre can click away to some other blog or news as you\u2019ll find nothing valuable in my comments (just make sure you come back in a sec and read about Once a Pawn, below). I don\u2019t know the name of the crew on stage who were opening for Murs, but they weren\u2019t bad. They featured three MCs and a turntable guy who pumped out dense but rather minimal beats beneath their rapping. Before their last number, they passed on a story about running into Conor Oberst at a party in Atlanta. \u201cAnd like all emo parties, there was only one hot girl there,\u201d the MC said. Just as he was about to swoop down on his prey, Oberst walked up to her and leaned against the wall, blocking his approach. He shoots, he scores! \u201cIt was tight,\u201d added another MC, while the lone white MC said, \u201cWe still like his music.\u201d Murs joined them for their last song, and it was like turning on switch to a power grid. Night and day. The first crew walked off and Murs stayed up there and tore into his set. Compared to the last crew, he was magnetic, pouncing on an audience that looked 10 times as punk as the crowd that was standing around listening to the Yeahs above them.\nEnd of review. Intro to this week\u2019s feature: Without a band story assignment, Reader editor Andy Norman called me last week and asked if I could do a little sumpthin\u2019 on Once a Pawn, whom I\u2019d never heard of. I\u2019m glad he did. I listened to the Lincoln trio\u2019s tunes on Myspace and made some calls. Read the results here and check them out at Scenefest this weekend.

[295-296]\nINDICTMENTS found and returned in the Superior Court Department on September 28, 1983.\nA pretrial motion to suppress evidence was heard by Robert J.

Curhan, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.\nSMITH, J. The defendants, Reynaldo Alcedo Jiminez and Jorge Mayans, were indicted for (1) unlawfully carrying a firearm (a nine millimeter \"Mac 10\" weapon), (2) unlawful possession of an altered firearm (a sawed-off shotgun), and (3) unlawful possession of cocaine, with intent to distribute, said cocaine being in excess of 200 grams. Both defendants were convicted on all three indictments following a jury trial. On appeal, they allege several errors which they claim require reversal of their convictions.\n1. Denial of suppression motions. Prior to trial, both defendants filed motions to suppress certain evidence that had been seized by the police as a result of a warrantless search of their automobile. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge denied their motions and filed a memorandum that contained his findings of fact. Those findings of fact are \"binding in the absence of clear error . . . and [we] view with particular respect the conclusions of law which are based on them.\" Commonwealth v. Correia, 381 Mass. 65, 76 (1980). While the judge's ultimate findings of fact and rulings of law, as they bear on issues of constitutional dimension, are open for reexamination by this court, such ultimate findings are \"entitled to substantial deference by this court.\" Commonwealth v. Bookman, 386 Mass. 657, 661 n.6 (1982). \"Questions of credibility are, of course, for the . . . judge to resolve. Commonwealth v. Meehan, 377 Mass. 552, 557 (1979).\" Commonwealth v. Bottari, 395 Mass. 777, 780 (1985). We now summarize the judge's findings of fact.\nOn September 14, 1983, at 1:30 A.M., Trooper Richard Whitehead was on routine patrol and driving south in a marked cruiser on Route 95 in North Attleborough. He turned off the highway at an exit and then drove onto the ramp leading to Route 95 north. At that point, he observed a late model Oldsmobile travelling north on Route 95 within the speed limit. He noticed that the automobile had its high beam headlights on. Another automobile was following it. Trooper Whitehead paced his cruiser so that both automobiles passed him before he entered the highway from the ramp.\nThe trooper observed that after the second automobile passed the Oldsmobile, the driver of the latter automobile did not lower the high beams. Thereupon, he closed the distance between his cruiser and the Oldsmobile to within two car lengths. From that distance, he observed that the validation sticker affixed to the license plate had expired at the end of August of 1983. At that point, he put on the dome lights and high beams of his cruiser and signaled the Oldsmobile to stop. He did not inform his headquarters that he had stopped a vehicle.\nTrooper Whitehead got out of the cruiser and walked toward the Oldsmobile. He noticed that there were two males in the automobile. The driver of the Oldsmobile, subsequently identified as Jorge Mayans, stepped out of the automobile. He put his hands in the air, head high, palms forward, in a position commonly thought of as one of surrender. He started to walk toward Trooper Whitehead. This unusual behavior aroused the trooper's concern. He ordered Mayans to get back in his automobile three times, but Mayans failed to do so. Mayans then stated that he did not have a license and that he was driving because the passenger was ill.\nThe trooper then escorted Mayans to the passenger door of the automobile. As he did so, he saw the passenger, who was still in the automobile, and was later identified as Reynaldo Alcedo Jiminez, reach down very quickly toward the bottom of the passenger seat. Trooper Whitehead ordered Jiminez out of the automobile and asked him for some identification. Jiminez gave him a Florida license in the name of Alcedo. The license appeared to be in order. The trooper asked Jiminez\nabout the ownership of the automobile. He replied that it was a rental automobile and showed the rental agreement to Whitehead. The trooper noted that the agreement was in the name of one Castillo, not Alcedo. He asked Jiminez for some explanation and was informed that Castillo was a member of the family.\nAt this point, the trooper asked Jiminez why he had ducked down quickly while sitting in the passenger seat. Up to the time the trooper asked that question, Jiminez had been very courteous and polite. However, upon hearing this question, his expression changed and he appeared shaken, grim, and anxious. He looked at Mayans and did not answer the question. Officer Whitehead then became concerned about his own safety. He ordered the two men to walk forward to the front of their automobile, where he had them stand in front of the headlights. The trooper then positioned himself behind the passenger door. He swept his hand under the front passenger seat, where he discovered a loaded nine millimeter Mac 10 semi-automatic weapon. Trooper Whitehead asked the men if either had a license for the gun. Jiminez responded, saying that he had a Florida license but not with him. The trooper then told the men that they were under arrest. He ordered the two men to lie on the ground, which they did after the order was repeated several times.\nTrooper Whitehead went back to his cruiser and radioed for assistance. Two police officers from North Attleborough arrived and, shortly thereafter, a State police cruiser. After the two defendants were placed in the cruiser, Trooper Whitehead continued the search of the defendants' automobile. Over the visor on the passenger side, he found a foil packet with a white powdery substance inside, which was later determined to be cocaine. Trooper Whitehead then removed the keys from the ignition and opened the trunk. He found a loaded sawed-off shotgun. Next to the shotgun was a brown paper bag with two parcels inside. Both parcels, it was later determined, contained cocaine.\na. The \"pursuit\" of the defendants' automobile by the police. The defendants claim that Trooper Whitehead \"pursued\" their automobile without legal justification before he observed that\nthe validation sticker on the license plate had expired and, therefore, they contend that their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated.\nPrior to the time that he signaled the driver of the defendants' automobile to stop, Trooper Whitehead's actions could not be characterized as a \"pursuit.\" After he first saw the automobile, the trooper simply positioned his cruiser a short distance behind the defendants' automobile in order to observe its operation. At that point he did not attempt to stop it, nor was he pursuing it \"to effect a stop.\" Commonwealth v. Thibeau, 384 Mass. 762, 764 (1981). The following of an automobile by the police did not \"clash[ ] with individual rights [of the defendants].\" Commonwealth v. Wooden, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 417, 419 (1982). In addition, we note that Trooper Whitehead and the defendants were travelling on a public highway at the time the cruiser was following the defendants' automobile. Surveillance of an automobile by a police officer does not encroach upon the privacy interests of the occupants where, as here, the officer makes his observations from a place where he is legally entitled to be. See Commonwealth v. Oreto, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 581, 584-586 (1985).\nb. Search of the automobile trunk. Neither defendant challenges the judge's decision upholding the warrantless search of the passenger compartment. Mayans argues, however, that the extension of that search into the trunk was illegal because it was not justified by probable cause or exigent circumstances.\nOver sixty years ago the Supreme Court established an automobile exception to the warrant requirement when it held that a warrantless search of an automobile by a police officer who has \"reasonable or probable cause for believing that the automobile which he stops . . . has contraband . . . therein\" does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 156 (1925). More recently, the Court upheld the warrantless search of an automobile trunk. United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798 (1982). In Ross the Court held that \"[i]f probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the\nsearch\" (emphasis supplied). United States v. Ross, supra at 825. See Commonwealth v. King, 389 Mass. 233, 247 (1983). Here, Mayans concedes that the police had probable cause to search the automobile for weapons. Once a firearm and contraband had been found in the passenger compartment the police were justified in searching the trunk, \"the trunk clearly being a `part of the vehicle' capable of concealing `the object of the search,' [i.e. drugs or weapons].\" [Note 2] United States v. Rickus, 737 F.2d 360, 367 (3d Cir. 1984), quoting from Ross at 825. [Note 3]\n2. The questioning of Commonwealth witnesses by the judge. As part of its case against the defendants, the Commonwealth introduced firearm certificates (G. L. c. 140, Section 121A) and drug analysis certificates (G. L. c. 147, Section 4D). To lay the foundation for introduction of these certificates the Commonwealth called two police officers as witnesses. During the course of their respective examinations the judge asked several questions of each officer. The defendants contend that in questioning these witnesses, the judge abdicated his role as an impartial arbiter and assumed the mantle of the prosecutor, thereby depriving them of a fair trial. We rule, however, that there was no error.\nThe first police officer, in answer to the prosecutor's questions, testified that he delivered the firearms found in the defendants' automobile to the ballistics laboratory in Boston. When the Commonwealth moved for admission in evidence of\nthe related firearm certificates, however, the judge refused to admit them, ruling that the Commonwealth was also required to establish when the witness retrieved the weapons from the laboratory in Boston. [Note 4] The judge then proceeded to ask the witness a half dozen questions regarding the date when the witness retrieved the weapons from the laboratory. The answers were apparently satisfactory, because the firearm certificates were subsequently allowed in evidence.\nThe second police officer who was the subject of judicial questioning testified, in response to questions from the prosecutor, that he had taken three packages containing a white powdery substance to the laboratory in Boston for analysis. When the Commonwealth moved to admit in evidence the three corresponding certificates of analysis, the judge sustained the defendants' objections to their admission on the ground that the certificates had not been linked to the packages submitted for analysis. The prosecution then asked the witness for the laboratory number assigned to the three packages. At that point, the judge took over the questioning of the witness. He asked the witness several questions about the laboratory number and eventually admitted the drug analysis certificates. [Note 5]\nA trial judge is the \"`guiding spirit and the controlling mind at a trial.'\" Commonwealth v. Dias, 373 Mass. 412, 416 (1977). As such, he \"may properly question a witness, even where to do so may strengthen the Commonwealth's case, so long as the examination is not partisan in nature, biased, or a display of belief in the defendant's guilt.\" Ibid. Furthermore,\nhe may \"ask questions to clarify a point, to prevent perjury, or to develop trustworthy testimony.\" Commonwealth v. Fitzgerald, 380 Mass. 840, 847 (1980). A trial judge, of course, should use his \"power to ask questions with restraint\". Ibid.\nThe questioning of the witnesses in this case was not partisan, nor did it convey to the jury the impression that the judge believed the defendants were guilty. Neither police officer questioned by the judge was a witness to the crime, and their testimony was technical in nature. The judge's questioning was obviously intended to clarify certain points relative to the introduction of the certificates in evidence. Moreover, the judge told the jury not to attach any significance to the fact that he asked the questions. [Note 6] \"We are not unmindful of the observation of Francis Bacon on the `overspeaking judge' and we have not favored except in extenuating circumstances the takeover of questioning by a judge during the course of trial.\" Commonwealth v. Campbell, 371 Mass. 40, 45 (1976). However, in the circumstances presented here, there was no error.\n3. Discharge of empanelled juror. After the close of the evidence and prior to the commencement of deliberations, one of the empanelled jurors requested to be excused from further service. The judge held a hearing in open court, outside the presence of the jury panel. The juror stated that she was presently employed but had just learned of a job opportunity at another company. She called that company for a job interview but was forced to accept an appointment which conflicted with the next scheduled court day. In response to a question from the judge, she stated that she could call the company and attempt\nto postpone the interview but was unsure whether the job would be left open for her. She also stated that the job interview was important to her. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge discharged the juror, over the objections of defense counsel. [Note 7] They claim that the judge abused his discretion in dismissing the juror.\nThere do not appear to be any cases that deal with the procedure involving the discharge of an empanelled juror prior to the commencement of deliberations. [Note 8] However, cases that are concerned with the interpretation of a statute that permits a discharge of a deliberating juror form a useful background for our analysis. Commonwealth v. Haywood, 377 Mass. 755, 765-770 (1979). Commonwealth v. Webster, 391 Mass. 271, 275-276 (1984). Commonwealth v. Connor, 392 Mass. 838, 842-847 (1984).\nGeneral Laws c. 234, Section 26B, as amended through St. 1979, c. 344, Section 9A, provides for substitution of an alternate juror if a deliberating juror \"dies, or becomes ill, or is unable to perform his duty for any other good cause shown to the court.\" Those occasions mentioned in the statute are precisely the same circumstances that would permit the discharge of an empanelled juror prior to the commencement of deliberations. State v. Trent, 157 N.J. Super. 231, 239 (1978), rev'd on other grounds, 79 N.J. 251 (1979), cited in Commonwealth v. Connor, 392 Mass. 838, 845 n.4 (1984). The Commonwealth contends that the juror was discharged for \"good cause\". It has been held that \"good cause,\" as it appears in Section 26B, \"includes only reasons personal to a juror, having nothing whatsoever to do with the issues of the case or with the juror's relationship with his fellow jurors.\" Commonwealth v. Connor, supra at 844-845. Here, that standard was met, as the juror was\ndischarged because of a personal situation, not connected to her relationship with her fellow jurors or her views on the case. We recognize that not every personal situation will justify the dismissal of an empanelled juror prior to deliberations (see note 8, supra). However, in this case the job interview was important to the juror. A continuation of her jury service might well have resulted in a hardship in light of a possible loss of a job opportunity. In the circumstances, the judge did not abuse his discretion in discharging the juror prior to deliberations.\n4. Other issues. The other issues raised by the defendants are without merit and do not warrant extended discussion.\na. The judge's decision to admit in evidence the firearm discovered underneath the passenger seat was not error. It was authenticated by Trooper Whitehead, and there was adequate evidence of the chain of custody. Any weaknesses in the chain affected the weight rather than the admissibility of that evidence. Commonwealth v. Berth, 385 Mass. 784, 791 (1982).\nb. Jiminez's motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun on the ground that no evidence was introduced as to the length of the barrel was properly denied. There was ample evidence in regard to the barrel. The firearm itself was placed in evidence. The jury could readily observe that its barrel was several inches less than eighteen inches. Two police officers described the firearm as a \"sawed-off shotgun.\" See Commonwealth v. Sperrazza, 372 Mass. 667, 670 (1977) (testimony that weapon in question was a \"revolver\" or a \"handgun\" held sufficient to support the conclusion that the barrel was less than sixteen inches, as revolvers or handguns are ordinarily short firearms). In sum, the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the length of the barrel was less than eighteen inches.\nc. The citation to the statute under which Mayans was charged with unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun was typed incorrectly. [Note 9] Mayans filed a motion for a required finding of\nnot guilty based on the defect. His motion was denied by the judge.\nThe body of the indictment listed the date and location of the alleged crime. It correctly stated the nature of the crime with which the defendant was charged. The description satisfied art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution and Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(a), 378 Mass. 849 (1979). Moreover, Mayans does not even claim that he was prejudiced by the defect. His contention that the judge erred borders on the frivolous.\nd. Mayans' contention that G. L. c. 94C, Section 32E(b)(3), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, Section 11, is unconstitutionally vague was rejected in Commonwealth v. Maracic, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 722 (1984).\nJudgments affirmed.\n[Note 1] Two of the companion cases are against Jiminez and three are against Jorge Mayans.\n[Note 2] Mayans relies on Commonwealth v. Ford, 394 Mass. 421 (1985), for his argument that the search of the trunk was unreasonable. In Ford, a police officer opened the trunk of an impounded automobile for the purpose of securing certain personal property. He saw a rifle in the trunk and seized it. The court held that the warrantless search was unreasonable because the storage search was not conducted pursuant to standard police procedures. In addition, the court noted that \"there was neither probable cause to search nor any special circumstances, such as an emergency, to justify a warrantless search without probable cause.\" Commonwealth v. Ford, 394 Mass. 421, 427 n.4 (1985). In the instant case, there was probable cause to search the automobile.\n[Note 3] United States v. Rickus, supra, also illustrates the wide variety of materials that some defendants have been found to have carried in the trunks of their automobiles. In that case the police found a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol and a mask of Leonid Brezhnev.\n[Note 4] The correctness of that ruling is not before us.\n[Note 5] It was not until well after the judge questioned the second witness that the defendants objected to the judicial questioning and requested a mistrial. The objection and the request were not timely. \"While we understand the natural reluctance of trial counsel to object to questions . . . coming from a judge, sometimes trial counsel's duty to protect his client's rights requires him to object, preferably at the bench out of the jury's hearing.\" Commonwealth v. Fitzgerald, 380 Mass. 840, 846 (1980). An examination of this record does not show that counsel for either defendant was reluctant to object to any action by the judge. Therefore, as there was no justification for the defendants' failures to make timely objection, we examine their contentions under the \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard. Commonwealth v. Freeman, 352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).\n[Note 6] During the course of his remarks to the jury the judge told them not to \"draw any inferences from anything that I may ask in the questioning. I'm known as a judicial interferer, the lawyers don't like it sometimes, but I stick my nose in and ask questions and they may not like my asking questions.\" Counsel for the defendants have seized on the phrase \"judicial interferer\" and argue that it supports their argument that the judge improperly interfered with the trial.\nAs we have noted in the body of the opinion, the judge's intervention in the case by asking questions was not error. The fact that the judge stated to the jury that he is known, apparently by some lawyers, as a \"judicial interferer\" did not turn his intervention into an example of judicial interference.\n[Note 7] Because alternate jurors had been empanelled, the verdicts against the defendants were returned by a twelve person jury.\n[Note 8] The matter is now covered in G. L. c. 234A, Section 39, as amended by St. 1984, c. 189, Section 158, which provides in part: \"The court shall have authority to excuse and discharge an impanelled juror prior to jury deliberations after a hearing upon a finding of extreme hardship.\" That statute did not apply to jury trials in Bristol County at the time of the judge's action.\n[Note 9] The indictment refers to G. L. c. 269, Section 10C, rather than G. L. c. 269, Section 10(c). The miscitation is repeated on the front of the indictment.", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 77, "original_length": 24174, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.97, "perplexity": 227.3, "bucket": "head"}

The students and the teaching and administrative staff are a mixture of more than 10 nationalities from all over the world.\nMadinat Al-Oloum is an Arabic term which means \u201cThe Science City\u201d. The name of the school was conceived in a vision of creating an educational institution that promotes science and technology in the modern world guided by the teachings of the Islamic religion.\nThe school is located along King Abdullah Road near King Abdullah Palace. It was founded in 2009 with an initial enrollment of 313 students and with a total of 43 teachers and administrative staff. By now, the enrollment has increased to more than a thousand (1110 as of the academic school year 2016-2017), and as a result, the total number of teachers and administrative staff has also increased to more than two hundred (219 as of the academic year 2016-2017). This change in the number of enrollees made the school to establish another branch to house nursery, kindergarten, and grades 1 to 3 classes. At present, the school has three buildings, two are in Marwa Street along King Abdullah Road where the grades 4 to 12 girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 sections are located, and the other is in Jareer Street where KG and grades 1 to 3 for both boys and girls are located.\nTo achieve the school beliefs and aims, and to meet the school expectations and the need for modern education in the changing times, the school was established with programs that follow an American curriculum and that is based on the Common Core State Standards.\nOn September 30, 2010, the school received its first recognition and accreditation from the North-West Accreditation Commission which later on became a part of the AdvancED Accreditation Commission in April of 2012.\nAiming to meet the school vision and mission, the school did its best to increase the school\u2019s strength every year. Throughout its history, Madinat Al-Oloum Intenational School has maintained a commitment to providing the highest caliber of artistic, scientific, religious, cultural, and educational experience to all students including the skilled, the talented or the gifted students, and the academically struggling students as well.\nMadinat Al-Oloum International School (MOIS) offers kindergarten to high school programs (K-12) that are based on the Common Core State Standards followed by American international schools. MOIS focuses on integrating programs based on American curricula and educational practices that enrich the Arab heritage and reflect the Islamic culture.\nUpon its founding, the school board aims to establish MOIS as an American international school where students are well-educated with high morals and good manners with special emphasis on Islamic values.\nMOIS prepares students for American standardized tests like the SAT and Subject SAT which would qualify them to get the American Diploma that will enable them to join most Arab and international universities according to their GPA and scores. Moreover, the school also offers IELTS course sessions specifically to grade 12 students because of the fact that most international universities require this standardized test in admitting students whose first language is not English.\nMOIS also prepares students to respond to the future challenges of their college education; hence, the school requires students to prepare projects as final requirements for graduation. The computer department for instance required all graduating students to submit projects using vb.net or visual basic application for programming. Among these projects are (1) SAT Tansik Calculator, (2) A program that provides profiles for each member of the school including the students and the staff, and (3) Developing Windows application to help senior students choose a university.\nAs future leaders, the students are also required to join community services. Such services include hygiene and sanitation, helping the poor in the streets of Riyadh, and assisting and serving the entire community of the school such as the school library, the school laboratory, and the school staff rooms among others.\nTo meet the school aims and to strengthen all the aspects of the school, the administration created various committees headed by competent staff members. These committees are for curriculum development, integration, skills development, technology development, Islamic awareness, maintenance and hygiene, communication, policies and assessment, and feedback and performance diagnostics among others. The school collaborates these school aims and efforts to stakeholders by establishing the Parents\u2019 Council and the Students\u2019 Council to make all school stakeholders be aware of all these recent developments, and to make parents and students one of the main contributors of the school\u2019s development.\nAs one of the finest international schools of the city of Riyadh, the school always finds ways to inculcate among students the school vision \u2013 \u201cLearn Today, Lead Tomorrow\u201d. This vision is reflective of the school mission in creating well-prepared individuals cognitively and behaviorally while focusing on developing their psychomotor skills. Guided by the school\u2019s vision and mission, the teachers and the staff in collaboration with the parents and the community, all work hand-in-hand to make sure that all students become successful not only in the school, but in their lives as a whole.\nMOIS Achievements\n(For 2016-2017 till February 2017)\nFrom: MOIS Administration\nTo: All Stakeholders\nBased on the previous students\u2019 results diagnostics, stakeholders\u2019 survey results analysis, and assessment of different school activities and practices, MOIS has created an improvement plan to improve the school\u2019s performance in different aspects. Though the improvement plan is still ongoing, it is important to communicate our school\u2019s achievements with all of the school\u2019s stakeholders, as partners in the education process.\nBased on what are mentioned above, we have listed below the school achievements since the establishment of the school till February of 2017, focusing on the major achievements that would lead to noticeable changes and development. We are hoping that they meet your expectations.\nGeneral Achievements\n1- Opening a new branch of the school in Jareer Street for grade levels K to 3. The new building is suitable for the learning needs of these grade levels.\n2- Providing a suitable learning environment for students such as suitable classrooms based on modern standards and conditions, and by not utilizing 90% of the 3rd floor.\n3- Developing the school building facilities including the schools plumbing cycle, and the playground\u2019s floor cover; fixing, updating, and developing the Science lab, the computer lab, the multimedia room, and the library ; changing the school\u2019s roof cover by adding a protection to the ceiling to prevent rain leak problems; changing the whiteboards, and many others.\n4- Establishing the school\u2019s electronic system or E2SKOOL. The electronic system will facilitate communication with parents on different levels. The system is dynamic to make it easy for parents to communicate with the school at any time for the purpose of getting information about his children in their academic progress and behavior reports; getting informed about the school\u2019s financial requirements; asking for excuses and permissions; and communicating problems. Some aspects of the system are still currently working on static a mode, and it is on an ongoing development process to reach the mentioned target.\n5- Submitting the weekly plans through the school\u2019s electronic website, and the school\u2019s Facebook page.\n6- Applying modern technology applications, like smart boards for grade levels 7 to 12, and computer devices for grade levels 4 to 12.\n7- Applying a number of surveys that covers all stakeholders. The survey\u2019s results were successfully analyzed. The analyzed data are to be used to update the school plans to reach stakeholders\u2019 expectations.\n8- Choosing highly qualified teachers according to the regulations and conditions of the Ministry of Education.\n9- Activating successfully the Students\u2019 Council. The council board was chosen based on internal school elections. The council is a basic link between the school\u2019s administration and students in all grade levels.\n10- Activating a number of school committees including :\n- Skills Development Committee that focuses on developing the skills of teachers, students and parents which help in achieving the school vision and mission.\n- Integration Committee that focuses on integrating learning between all subjects for students and for teachers as well, to meet the school vision and mission.\n- Technology Committee that focuses on developing technology applications in the school, which is required to reach the school\u2019s purpose.\n- And other committees such as, Islamic Awareness Committee, Stakeholders Feedback Diagnostic Committee, Students\u2019 Performance Diagnostic Committee, Curriculum Development Committee, Executive Summary Committee, and Improvement Plan Committee among others.)\n11- Meeting the members of the Parents\u2019 Council to discuss basic concerns of stakeholders. An effective parent\u2019s council had three meetings during the current year, and valuable suggestions were presented by the members to solve the noted problems. Positive discussions between the council and the governing body were so helpful to develop MOIS plans.\n12- Training on the Crisis Plan was successfully conducted. The school personnel and students were successfully trained on the crisis plan, especially the evacuation process. The students were trained on both methods of instructions theoretically and practically.\n13- Disseminating school-wide hygiene awareness. Different activities were applied by the school clinic to spread hygiene awareness, to follow up students\u2019 health, and to support students who need medical care.\n1- Reaching a qualified degree of systematic communication and documentation processes.\n2- Having better and effective means of communication with parents, through different channels like \u2013 parents\u2019 meetings , teacher-parent individual meeting , Facebook page, the school website, letters, and memos.\n3- Unifying the vision of the whole school, allowing departments to have noticeable integration.\n4- Encouraging and supporting the application of new approaches that serve the educational process.\n5- Developing the Parent/Student Handbook for the KG section.

For example, a project allowed high school students to research, present, and assess materials related to historic figures who contributed to the progress of humanity. Another project allowed students to form group seminars in which they discussed and assessed free reading materials. In some other grade levels, math projects that integrate Art, Science, and Social studies with Math were applied. Other cross subject projects were applied as well.\n12- Helping high school students develop their presentation skills. Even those who found difficulty expressing themselves orally were encouraged to overcome this obstacle. Peer assessment motivated students to work as critics and not only as audience or recipients.\n13- Utilizing some technology applications to grade levels 4 to 12 concerning Virtual Laboratory. Qur\u2019an and English departments are using simple phonics lab.\n14- Applying several competitions including:\n- The schools 7th Science Fair competition that focuses on the steps of the scientific methods, and helping students to develop cooperation skills and leadership skills, as well as developing their science information and interest.\n- Applying Qur\u2019an memorization and reading competitions for both students and parents.\n- Applying writing competition for grades 7 to 12.\n15- Designing programs for low-achieving students in all subjects, and another program for gifted students.\n16- Applying a full plan of (Subject Activity Week) that focuses on teaching students based on different types of activities that meet students\u2019 different types of learning.

SAT trial test is applied at the end of every year for grade 10, and SAT results are to be analyzed for grades 11 and 12.\nThe purpose of the diagnostic test as mentioned in the sent letter is to decide students\u2019 academic level based on an international test.\n21- Analyzing summative assessments through a concept-based method. Students summative assessment results were concept-based analyzed to determine the concept weakness in each grade level which helps in the school\u2019s annual curricula design.\n22- Applying an intensive course for low-achieving students in grades 1 \u2013 3 in both English and Math subjects. The course includes the basics of each of the subjects to help students reach the required background knowledge for his grade level educational expectations.\n23- Communicating successfully the student\u2019s level of performance to parents by more than one method such as report cards, evaluation follow up sheets, and progress reports.\n24- Applying a multiple intelligence test for grade levels (1 \u2013 3). The test gives an indication about the most popular types of intelligence for each student. Results were used to redesign the lesson strategies according to the type of learning.\n25- Applying a survey to students who graduated from MOIS to gather information about how much our program is convenient to different university requirements. The results admit that the school program is strong and effective for our graduates.\n26- Supporting and enriching the school\u2019s Arabic and Islamic Studies curricula by incorporating additional standards from the Ministry of Education to guarantee full advantage of studying the said subjects.\n27- Encouraging students to read is one of the school's basic interests.

Of the 33 million users from around the world, about 0.6% were from South Carolina. With that being said, South Carolina has been ranked at number 36 for most unfaithful state in America.\nWhile analyzing the data from South Carolina, we found 218,840 users signed up for service. That is a staggering 85% male and 15% female. If you crunch those numbers is comes to 185,700 male users and 33,140 female users.\nThese users may have never paid for the service offered but they did create a profile. Ironically, we also found that there were 2,015 users in South Carolina that had paid for their account to be deleted. That means 1% of South Carolina users paid for delete. Of the 2,015 South Carolina users that paid for delete, 1,857 were male users and 158 users were female.\nIt has been interesting to learn about the users involved in the Ashley Madison leak.

In fact, with its self-contained setting and story, solid character arcs and numerous little \u201cWhedonesque\u201d moments, issues #26-30 are a true high water mark in Buffy\u2019s comics adventures.\nIn fact, it\u2019s reminiscent of nothing so much as The Empire Strikes Back, not in its narrative specificity, but the general tenor of the story. The Slayer Army is at a truly low point, but, unlike the far flung activities of the previous issues, this time they\u2019re all together, united in a common battle (there\u2019s literally a battle) against impossible odds. But they also have to deal with very old and long-festering personal issues, make important character revelations and pinpoint what\u2019s going to be the central struggle from here until the end of Season 8.\nAt the beginning of the story, Buffy, Xander and Willow are still holding down the fort with the Slayer Army in Scotland, but things aren\u2019t going well. They\u2019re facing increasingly monstrous threats and Twilight knows where they are. Faith and Giles are holed up in a bunker in Berlin (Faith points out the irony), also hiding from human and demon forces. And Andrew leads a contingent through the catacombs in Rome, where Slayers are being hunted. It seems as if everyone is going to have to do some relocating, and fast.\nThe entire gang eventually finds its way back to Scotland, where Buffy and Giles, for one, have a tearful reunion. But there\u2019s no time to savour their status as demons driving tanks and sporting Medieval Siege Engines are soon storming the Scottish castle, under the leadership of Twilight. It turns out that Twilight has been tracking Willow\u2019s magic use, and the magic use of the other wiccans she has recruited. What Willow perceives as their greatest strength has led the enemy right to their gates. Willow, by the way, has been enjoying magic a bit too much and this has made everyone nervous, given her history with the forces.\nBuffy eventually just orders retreat, and the entire army takes refuge in the submarine (appropriated from North Korea and introduced a few issues back). Now it\u2019s up to Willow to perform, as Buffy sees it, one last big act of magic. She teleports the submarine and everyone in it from the North Atlantic to a field in Tibet. Where Oz, meditating peacefully in a temple overlooking the valley that now contains the sub, gives his trademark thoughtful \u201chuh\u201d.\nThe relationship between Oz and Willow, the honesty with which the writers committed to their emotions, was one of the things that made Buffy the TV series so much better and more insightful than so many of its contemporaries. Buffy seemed to understand, in a way that most other shows and many people do not, that sexual orientation is a lifelong journey for some people and that individual circumstances and emotions are very much a part of that. A lesser show would have had Willow realize one day that she wasn\u2019t straight, have an affair with Tara and just leave Oz out completely, since he wasn\u2019t a major character. Instead, Whedon and company allowed Oz to break Willow\u2019s heart in a very human way, allowed her time to grieve and when she met Tara it wasn\u2019t so much a case of \u201cdeciding to be with a woman\u201d as deciding to be with that woman. Similarly, when Oz returns and expects him and Willow to pick up where they left off, no one is the \u201cenemy\u201d and no one is \u201cwrong\u201d in that situation. Tara is scared and hurt and Willow is confused. They muddle through, imperfectly. But Oz is emphatically not a homophobic \u201cbad guy\u201d. Whedon is too smart for that. Which is why it\u2019s impressive to see that dynamic, and that very mature approach to the subject, continued here.\nThe Slayer Army arrives to find that Oz has married a wonderful woman named Bayarrma (or \u201cBay\u201d) and they have a little boy named Kelden. Bay helped Oz deal with his affliction (he\u2019s a werewolf) through meditation and spiritual exercises that help him redirect the magical energy into the earth itself. This is, as she tells it, an old Tibetan trick. It isn\u2019t long before the Slayer Army, and Giles in particular, hits upon the idea of directing all the group\u2019s magical energy into the earth, allowing them to \u201chide\u201d from Twilight\u2019s magic detecting abilities. It would give them time to think and rest and heal, at least, so goes the logic.\nHealing is very much on Willow\u2019s mind, who is the most conflicted and confused in this new situation. Her challenges are on a number of fronts. For one thing, she\u2019s now being forced to \u201cgive up\u201d her magic and direct it back into the earth. Although she sees the logic of it, it isn\u2019t easy for Willow to lose the one thing that makes her special and powerful. She\u2019s also struggling personally, bitterly jealous at seeing her former lover happily married with a child, just as she always dreamt for them. Whereas Willow\u2019s personal life, with Kennedy and all the drama of the Slayer Army, seems difficult and painful next to Oz\u2019s idyllic life. In Star Wars terms, Willow is ripe to be tempted by the dark side.\nGiving up the magic isn\u2019t easy for anyone, by the way, including many in the Slayer Army. Slayers are by their very nature \u201cmagic all day every day,\u201d as Buffy puts it. Giving up their strength to avoid detection leaves them weak and vulnerable. They try their best to occupy themselves being useful to their hosts, planting crops and milking the Yak and such, but frustration and fear grow. And then, of course, the inevitable happens and Twilight finds them.\nBefore getting to the epic battle between Twilight and the newly-weakened Slayer Army, there\u2019s more significant character developments. Buffy and Faith get to spend some time together and find much of their former hostility is gone in the face of a new enemy and a more grown up sense of themselves. Buffy starts to realize that she\u2019s attracted to Xander, but is shocked and confused when she finds that Xander and Dawn are \u201ctogether\u201d, and very affectionate with each other. (Georges Jeanty makes masterful use of eye-lines, here, playing out many scenes of kissing etc between Xander and Dawn with Buffy sneaking a peek out of the corner of her eye.)\nAnd we shouldn\u2019t forget that Buffy\u2019s ex Riley Finn is ostensibly working for Twilight. Riley is one of many soldiers that contribute to the massive battle involving Tanks, Jeeps and military equipment. The Slayer Army also has to resort to that most dreaded of weapons: the gun. They don\u2019t have their normal powers, and they don\u2019t have Willow\u2019s magic, so they use whatever Chinese weapons are available. And, of course, the submarine.\nHere is where the Empire Strikes Back or even the Return of the Jedi elements come into play. The long battle (spread over two issues, it could easily fill one) is far more interesting than the repetitive yelling and clanking of most battle sequences, playing out in a series of vignettes that are sometimes heroic and sometimes quite funny. The best consisted of a group of Slayers rigging one of the now-abandoned submarine\u2019s torpedoes on a sled and sliding into the enemy forces, only then asking themselves, \u201cDo torpedoes work on land?\u201d The next frame, with the army celebrating and yelling, \u201ctorpedoes work on land!\u201d reaches almost Archer- level satire.\nTwo big plot points emerge during the epic Buffy \u201cwar movie\u201d that forms the last part of \u201cRetreat\u201d. One is that Riley is revealed to be on the side of the Slayer Army the whole time, working undercover in Twilight\u2019s organization. Buffy saves him and nurses him back to heath at the Slayer\u2019s improvised hospital. The second involves the forces that Willow, her witches, the Slayers and Oz (as well as some fellow werewolves) have been pumping into the earth. With a very mild spell, those forces are pulled back out with a vengeance, taking the forms of ancient Asian Goddesses and tearing the Twilight army to pieces. Unfortunately the Goddesses aren\u2019t that easily controlled and Buffy finds herself in the hands of one during the final skirmish.\nDropped to the earth by a giant blue Goddess (we should point out that this would probably not be the way they would go on TV), Buffy is knocked unconscious but wakes up floating high in the air, watching the battle unfold beneath her. The next two major arcs, \u201cTwilight\u201d and \u201cLast Gleaming\u201d, will bring us to the epic and tragic end of Buffy Season 8.\nTagged Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Georges Jeanty, Joss Whedon.
