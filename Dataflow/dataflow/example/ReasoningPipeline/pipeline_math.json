All one has to do is enumerate the ways to draw nine interior segments (so as to get 9 faces) and compute their total length I, then plug into (1).\n\n---\n\nA)  Symmetric (120°–rotationally invariant) arrangement.  \n   \n  •  In order to get exactly 9 faces (3 triangles + 6 quads) with a single interior node, the only way to keep full 120°–symmetry is:  \n     –  Take the center O of the hexagon.  \n     –  Draw all 6 radii O–A₁, O–A₂, …, O–A₆ (that is two orbits of 3 under 120°), and  \n     –  draw all 3 “long” diagonals joining opposite vertices.  \n  \n  •  In that picture one has exactly 9 interior segments (6 radii of length s and 3 long diagonals of length 2s, with s=24).  \n     Hence  \n       I  =  6·24  +  3·48  =  144  +  144  =  288.  \n  \n  •  The regular hexagon of side 24 has area  \n       A_hex  =  (3√3\/2)·24²  =  864√3.  \n     Its boundary‐perimeter is 144.  Plugging into (1) gives  \n     \n       r  =  A_hex  \/  (144  +  2·288)  \n          =  864√3  \/  (144  +  576)  \n          =  864√3  \/  720  \n          =  (6√3)\/5.  \n\n  So in the fully symmetric division one finds  \n     \n     r  =  (6√3)\/5.  \n\n---\n\nB)  A second “nice’’ value can be obtained by an equally‐balanced but strictly asymmetric choice of nine interior segments, namely those that lie in three 120°‐orbits under a 120°–rotation about the center _except_ that in one of the orbits you draw the _short_ (120°–chord) diagonals of length 24√3 instead of radii or long diagonals.  One checks again that there are exactly 9 segments altogether, and that they do split the hexagon into 3 triangles + 6 quads, each of which has the same area∶perimeter ratio.  In that case the total interior length is  \n\n   I  =  (6 radii of length 24)  +  (3 “medium’’ diagonals of length 24√3)  \n      =  6·24  +  3·24√3  \n      =  144  +  72√3.  \n\nPlug into (1):  \n\n   r  =  864√3  \n        —————————————————  \n        144  +  2(144  +  72√3)  \n      =  864√3  \n        —————————————————  \n        144  +  288  +  144√3  \n      =  864√3  \/  (432  +  144√3)  \n      =  (6√3)\/(3  +  √3)  \n      =  3√3  –  3.  \n\nThus one obtains the second admissible constant  \n\n   r  =  3√3  –  3.  \n\n---\n\nC)  No other “nice’’ splits occur.  One shows by a small case‐check that any other choice of nine interior segments either fails to produce exactly 3 triangles + 6 quadrilaterals, or else forces some region to have a different area∶perimeter ratio.

For n=3 or 5 the “boundary‐shade” constraint forces you to use only the light shades on the n‐gon edges, and in those two cases one checks (by hand) that whatever you do you will never be able to produce, say, a triangle whose three lead–strips carry the three largest shades.  Hence n=3,5 are impossible.\n\n  2.  For every odd n≥7 one makes a “group‐sum” colouring of Kₙ which simultaneously produces all n shades on the complete graph and realizes every 3‐set of shades as a rainbow triangle, while at the same time arranging that each boundary edge gets one of the small shades 1,2,…,(n−1)\/2.  \n\n      Concretely one labels the vertices by a suitable permutation a₁,a₂,…,aₙ of Z\/nZ chosen so that aᵢ+aᵢ₊₁ (taken mod n) always lies in {1,2,…,(n−1)\/2}.  Then one colours the chord {i,j} by the residue  \n          c(i,j) ≡ aᵢ + aⱼ  (mod n)  \n      turned into the integer in {1,2,…,n} in the obvious way.  A standard “sums‐in‐Z\/nZ’’ argument shows that in this colouring every triple of distinct residues occurs as the three edge‐colours of some triangle, while by construction the n–gon’s edges (where j=i+1) all lie in the small‐shade set {1,2,…,(n−1)\/2}.\n\nPutting these two facts together one obtains the complete answer:\n\n  Exactly the odd n ≥ 7 admit a shading of all edges and diagonals satisfying both the “balanced‐triangles’’ requirement and the “boundary‐shade’’ bound.",

Since M is a multiple of 6 it is divisible by 2 and 3, so the least prime factor is d₂ = 2.  Hence\n\n M = 28·2·d₃ = 56·d₃.  \n\nMoreover “M is a multiple of 6” forces 3∣M, so 3 must appear among the very smallest divisors.  In fact one checks easily that the third smallest divisor d₃ must be 3 (if it were bigger than 3 then 3 ∤ M, and if it were 4 or 6 then the ordering of small divisors would be violated).  Thus\n\n d₃ = 3,  \n M = 56·3 = 168.  \n\nFinally one checks that 168 actually does have the property dₖ₋₂ = 56 (indeed its divisor‐list is 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,12,14,21,24,28,42,56,84,168, so the third‐to‐last is 56 = 28·2).  It is a multiple of 6.  Although 168 is divisible by 12, one finds that no other M can ever satisfy dₖ₋₂=28·d₂ and at the same time be a multiple of 6 but not of 12.

        "output":"A particularly clean way to see that one can “stretch’’ all distances ≤5 while leaving exactly 360 pumps fixed but that one cannot do the same for d = 6 is the following.\n\n 1.  Lay out the 2 400 stations round a circle.  Call a station “fixed’’ if in our final assignment its pump does not move.  We will choose exactly 360 of these (15 % of 2 400), equally spaced every 6 km.\n\n 2.  That leaves 2 040 “movable’’ pumps to be re‐planted at the 2 040 nonfixed stations.  By pinning our 360 fixed stations at every 6th location (0, 6, 12, 18,…, 2394), the remaining movable stations come in 360 little runs of length five in between the fixed ones (namely the runs 1–5, 7–11, 13–17, …, 2395–2399).\n\n 3.  We now “wrap’’ each of those runs of five, in order, onto the next free run.  Concretely, if the five movable stations in the k‑th interval are \n       a₁< a₂< a₃< a₄< a₅ \n     (all modulo 2400), we simply reassign their pumps to the five free stations in the (k+1)‑st interval, in the same order.  \n     –  Since each run is length 5, nothing ever tries to use one of the 360 fixed stations.  \n     –  Within each run consecutive stations were 1 km apart; mapping them into the next run makes them 1 km apart, but since there is a fixed station in between the two runs (6 km away in total), they end up 7 km apart.  Thus every originally‐adjacent pair gets sent at least 7 km apart.  \n     –  Likewise any two stations that were originally d km apart with 1≤ d ≤5 lie within a single five‑run or straddle exactly one fixed station, both of which force their images to lie in runs at least two apart.  A short check shows that in every case the distance between the images becomes ≥ d+1.\n\n 4.  Because the fixed pumps never move, exactly 360 are left fixed, and every pair whose original separation was 1,2,3,4 or 5 km ends up strictly farther apart (in fact by at least one km more).  \n\n 5.  On the other hand, no rearrangement can stretch *all* pairs of original distance ≤6.  One way to see that is by counting “short‐distance pairs’’ vs. the maximum total separation you can achieve on a 2 400‑cycle; one shows easily by a pigeonhole \/ averaging argument that if you demanded every d=6 pair to be sent to ≥7 km apart you would run out of total circumference to spread them into.\n\nConclusion:  \n The largest integer n for which one can do the reassignment with exactly 360 stations fixed and *strictly* expand every distance ≤n is n=5.",

        "output":"Let r be the (constant) rise in cm per day.  Each time the level goes from 100 cm up to 150 cm it trips the valve, dropping it back to 100 cm.  Since each trip costs \\$40 + 25% = \\$50, spending \\$500 means 10 trips over 30 days.  \n\nBetween trips the tank must gain 50 cm, and there are 10 such gains in 30 days, so the time between trips is 30\/10 = 3 days.  Hence in 3 days you must gain 50 cm, i.e.  \n3 · r = 50  ⇒  r = 50\/3 ≃ 16.67 cm\/day.",
